that, with a view of doing the fullest justice to Regiments,
as well as to Individuals who have distinguished
themselves by their Bravery in Action with
the Enemy, an Account of the Services of every Regiment

the superintendence and direction of the Adjutant-General;
and that this Account shall contain the
following particulars, <em>viz.</em>,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>—— The Period and Circumstances of the Original
Formation of the Regiment; The Stations at
which it has been from time to time employed; The

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="r10">

<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must chiefly
depend upon the zeal and ardour, by which all who enter
into its service are animated, and consequently it is of the
highest importance that any measure calculated to excite the
spirit of emulation, by which alone great and gallant actions
are achieved, should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment of this
desirable object, than a full display of the noble deeds with
which the Military History of our country abounds. To hold
forth these bright examples to the imitation of the youthful
soldier, and thus to incite him to emulate the meritorious
conduct of those who have preceded him in their honourable
career, are among the motives that have given rise to the
present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed, announced
in the ‘London Gazette,’ from whence they are transferred
into the public prints: the achievements of our armies are thus
made known at the time of their occurrence, and receive the
tribute of praise and admiration to which they are entitled.
On extraordinary occasions, the Houses of Parliament have
been in the habit of conferring on the Commanders, and the
Officers and Troops acting under their orders, expressions of
approbation and of thanks for their skill and bravery, and these
testimonials, confirmed by the high honour of their Sovereign’s
Approbation, constitute the reward which the soldier most
highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice (which
appears to have long prevailed in some of the Continental
armies) for British Regiments to keep regular records of their
services and achievements. Hence some difficulty has been
experienced in obtaining, particularly from the old Regiments,
an authentic account of their origin and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence of His
Majesty having been pleased to command, that every Regiment
shall in future keep a full and ample record of its services at
home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country will henceforth
derive information as to the difficulties and privations
which chequer the career of those who embrace the military
profession. In Great Britain, where so large a number of
persons are devoted to the active concerns of agriculture,
manufactures, and commerce, and where these pursuits have,
for so long a period, been undisturbed by the <em>presence of war</em>,
which few other countries have escaped, comparatively little
is known of the vicissitudes of active service, and of the
casualties of climate, to which, even during peace, the British
Troops are exposed in every part of the globe, with little or
no interval of repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which the
country derives from the industry and the enterprise of the agriculturist
and the trader, its happy inhabitants may be supposed
not often to reflect on the perilous duties of the soldier and
the sailor,—on their sufferings,—and on the sacrifice of valuable
life, by which so many national benefits are obtained
and preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour, and endurance,
have shone conspicuously under great and trying difficulties;
and their character has been established in Continental
warfare by the irresistible spirit with which they have effected
debarkations in spite of the most formidable opposition, and
by the gallantry and steadiness with which they have maintained
their advantages against superior numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to the gallant exertions
of the Corps employed; but the details of their services, and
of acts of individual bravery, can only be fully given in the
Annals of the various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication, under
His Majesty’s special authority, by Mr. RICHARD CANNON,
Principal Clerk of the Adjutant-General’s Office; and while
the perusal of them cannot fail to be useful and interesting to
military men of every rank, it is considered that they will also
afford entertainment and information to the general reader,
particularly to those who may have served in the Army, or
who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who have served,
or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr">Esprit du Corps</i>—an attachment
to every thing belonging to their Regiment; to such
persons a narrative of the services of their own Corps cannot
fail to prove interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions
of the great,—the valiant,—the loyal, have always been of
paramount interest with a brave and civilized people. Great
Britain has produced a race of heroes who, in moments of
danger and terror, have stood, “firm as the rocks of their
native shore;” and when half the World has been arrayed
against them, they have fought the battles of their Country
with unshaken fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,—victories so complete and surprising,
gained by our countrymen,—our brothers—our fellow-citizens
in arms,—a record which revives the memory of the brave,
and brings their gallant deeds before us, will certainly prove
acceptable to the public.</p>

<p>Biographical memoirs of the Colonels and other distinguished
Officers, will be introduced in the Records of their respective
Regiments, and the Honorary Distinctions which have, from
time to time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying
the value and importance of its services, will be faithfully
set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record of each
Regiment will be printed in a distinct number, so that when
the whole shall be completed, the Parts may be bound up in
numerical succession.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793</div>

<p class="noindent">When the breaking out of the war with France in 1793
occasioned considerable additions to be made to the
British army, this regiment was raised in Ireland, under
commission bearing date 25th September, 1793, by Colonel
the Honourable Thomas de Burgh (afterwards
Earl of Clanricarde). Being recruited chiefly from the
province of Connaught, it assumed, as its distinctive appellation,
the name of “<span class="smcap">Connaught Rangers</span>;” and
when the new-levied regiments were numbered from
Seventy-Eight upwards, received for its number <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eight</span>.
Its facings were yellow, and it bore on its
colours and appointments a harp and crown, with the
motto “Quis separabit?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1794</div>

<p>It was not long before the active services of the new
regiment were called for in the field: in the summer of
1794 a reinforcement of seven thousand men, under the
command of Major-General the Earl of Moira, was sent
to join the army of the Duke of York in Flanders; and
of this force the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> Regiment, one thousand
strong, and commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel
Keppel, formed part. The expedition landed at Ostend
on the 26th of June, at which time the Duke of York,
pressed by superior numbers, was retiring upon Antwerp;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
and the Earl of Moira resolved not to attempt the
defence of Ostend, but to endeavour to join his Royal
Highness. After a tedious and difficult march, in the
face of a superior and victorious enemy, whose troops
were already overrunning the country in all directions,
his Lordship arrived at <span class="smcap">Alost</span>, where he was attacked
by the French, on the 6th of July, with great fury; the
enemy was, however, repulsed; the steadiness and valour
of the troops, with the skill of their leader, overcame all
difficulties, and the junction between Lord Moira’s corps
and the army under his Royal Highness the Duke of
York was accomplished at Malines, on the 9th of July,
when the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> was formed in brigade with
the Fifteenth, Fifty-third, and Fifty-Fourth Regiments.</p>

<p>In the harassing operations of the autumn of 1794,
and in the disastrous winter campaign and retreat which
followed, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> had a full share. For
some time it formed part of the garrison of Bergen-op-Zoom,
where it was reviewed by the Prince of Orange
and some Hessian officers of high rank, and received
much commendation for its appearance and efficiency.
When Bergen-op-Zoom was considered no longer tenable,
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> was withdrawn in the night by
boats, under the command of Lieutenant (afterwards
Admiral Sir Home) Popham, and proceeded to join the
army near Nimeguen; in which fortress it was also subsequently
placed in garrison, but was withdrawn a few
nights before the surrender. It was then formed in
brigade with the Eighth, Thirty-Seventh, Forty-Fourth,
and Fifty-Seventh Regiments, under the command of
Major-General de Burgh, and stationed near the Waal,
to defend the passage of that river.</p>

<p>On the 27th of November, 1794, General John Reid
was appointed Colonel of the Regiment, in succession to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
Major-General de Burgh, who was removed to the Sixty-Sixth
Regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1795</div>

<p>The Waal having become frozen so as to bear an
army with its <i lang="fr">matériel</i>, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> retired
across the Leek, and the men, being exposed to the
storms of a severe winter, endured great hardships. Robert
Brown states in his Journal (7th January, 1795),
“Nearly half the army are sick, and the other half much
fatigued with hard duty; this is now the tenth night
since any of us had a night’s rest.” The enemy continuing
to advance in overwhelming numbers, the army
retreated during the night of the 14th of January,
through a country covered with ice and snow. On the
subsequent days, numbers of the men, exhausted with
fatigue and want of food, were unable to proceed, and
many were frozen to death by the road-side. The
<span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> proceeded to Deventer, the capital of
a district in the province of Overyssel; from whence the
Regiment marched on the 27th of January, and, continuing
its route for several days across a region of ice
and snow, arrived in the Duchy of Bremen.</p>

<p>In April the Regiment embarked for England; after its
arrival it went into quarters at Norwich, and proceeded
to fill up its thinned ranks with recruits from Ireland.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1795, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> was ordered
to form a part of the expedition under Major-General
Sir Ralph Abercrombie, destined for the reduction
of the French West India Islands, and accordingly
embarked under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel
(now Viscount) Beresford. The disasters which attended
the sailing of this expedition form a sad page in the naval
history of England, and were not easily obliterated from
the memory of the survivors. Various circumstances co-operated
to delay the fleet, under Admiral Christian, till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
a very late period of the year, and it had scarcely quitted
port when it encountered a hurricane by which it was
completely dispersed. Many of the ships foundered at
sea; some returned disabled into English ports; some
were taken by the enemy, and a small part only were
able to weather the storm and proceed to their original
destination. The dispersion of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
Regiment was as complete as that of the fleet; two companies,
commanded by Captain Trotter, were all that
reached the West Indies; of the others, some were in
the captured ships, some in those which put back to
England, and a crazy transport, in which one division
under Captain Vandeleur was embarked, was actually
blown through the Straits of Gibraltar as far into the
Mediterranean as Carthagena. Here the vessel was
frapped together, and with great difficulty navigated back
to Gibraltar, where the men were removed out of her, and
on loosening the frapping the transport fell to pieces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1796</div>

<p>The two companies which reached the West Indies,
after being employed in the reduction of Grenada and
the siege of St. Lucie, returned to England in the
autumn of 1796, when the whole battalion was again
assembled, and embarked under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel
Beresford for Jersey, where its numbers
were once more completed to a full establishment, by
recruits from Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1799</div>

<p>On the 1st of January, 1799, it sailed from Portsmouth
for the East Indies, still commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel
Beresford, and arrived at Bombay 10th
June, 1800.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1800</div>

<p>The next active service of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> was
with the expedition which the government of India fitted
out, under the command of Major-General Sir David
Baird, in 1800, to co-operate with the army under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Abercrombie, in the expulsion
of the French from Egypt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1801</div>

<p>The troops sailed from India in December, and arrived
at Cosseir on the Red Sea in June, 1801. On this occasion,
in the fourteen days’ march across what is called
the “Long Desert” from Cosseir on the Red Sea to
Kenna on the Nile, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> formed the van
of Sir David Baird’s army, preceding the rest of the
troops a day’s march, and it was thus the first British
regiment to tread this dangerous route.</p>

<p>From Kenna it sailed in boats down the Nile, and
reached Grand Cairo on the day on which that fortress
surrendered to the British troops under Major-General
(afterwards Lord) Hutchinson.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1803</div>

<p>On the final evacuation of Egypt by the English, the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>, instead of returning to India, as had
been originally intended, proceeded to England in order
to be reduced, but arrived at Portsmouth on the very
day that the war with France was renewed, the 5th of
May, 1803, and was consequently saved from that fate.
Its numbers being then much weakened by time and
casualties, and its effective strength still more so by the
ophthalmia, which the soldiers had contracted in Egypt,
the corps was ordered into quarters in Kent and Sussex,
where it remained three years.</p>

<p>Amongst the measures of defence taken at this time by
the government to secure the country against the invasion
with which it was threatened by Buonaparte, a general
order was issued from the Horse-Guards on the 2nd
of December, 1803, commanding that (in case of the
enemy’s effecting a landing in any part of the United
Kingdom) all officers below the rank of general officers,
and not attached to any particular regiment, should report
themselves in person to the general officer commanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
the district in which they might happen to reside;
and requesting all general officers not employed on the
staff to transmit immediately their addresses to the Adjutant-General.
The Colonel of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>,
the Veteran <span class="smcap">General Reid</span>, was then in his 82nd year;
yet he immediately obeyed the summons, and transmitted
his address in a letter so spirited as to deserve a
place in the memoirs of the regiment which he commanded,
and upon which his gallantry reflected honour.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">“<i>London, 6th December, 1803.</i></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—In obedience to the orders of His Royal

London Gazette of Saturday last, for all General
Officers not employed on the Staff to report to you

I am still ready, if my services be accepted, to use my

</div>


<div class="sidenote">1804</div>

<p class="p1">A second battalion was formed in 1804, and a statement
of its services is given at the end of this record.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805</div>

<p>In 1805, the regiment being then quartered in East
Bourne barracks, together with the Derby Militia and
a detachment of the Tenth Hussars, the whole under the
command of Lieut.-Colonel the Honourable Alexander
Duff, of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>, a quarrel unfortunately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
occurred between the soldiers of the two corps, which
might have led to very serious results; but which that
officer, with a degree of tact and knowledge of the nature
and feelings of a British soldier that were highly creditable
to him, not only rendered innoxious, but converted
into a source of eventual benefit to the regiment.</p>

<p>The result of this conduct on the part of the commanding
officer was the making of the two regiments
such attached friends, that when, a short time after, the
Derby Militia was permitted to furnish three hundred
and fifty men to regiments of the line, more than two
hundred of the number volunteered for the “<span class="smcap">Connaught
Rangers</span>,” although they were beset by the officers and
recruiting-parties of many English regiments, who naturally,
but vainly, hoped to gain the preference over a corps
then exclusively Irish. The volunteers from the Derby
Militia proved as good and gallant soldiers as any in the
army, and a very large portion of them were killed in
the various actions in which the regiment was afterwards
engaged.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1806</div>

<p>It was about this period that His Royal Highness the
Commander in Chief ordered Sir John Moore’s improved
system of drill to be adopted throughout the army:
under the active superintendence of Lieutenant-Colonel
Duff, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> was quickly perfected in the
new system, and was, in all respects, in the highest state
of discipline. The commander of the district, Major-General
Sir Arthur Wellesley, was reviewing Major-General
Sir Brent Spencer’s brigade, to which the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> belonged, in Crowhurst Park, near
Hastings, when he received an express for the regiment to
march on the following day to Portsmouth, and join the
expedition under Brigadier-General Robert Craufurd.
When the review was over, Sir Arthur made known the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
orders he had received, and addressed the regiment in
very flattering terms, concluding a short and animated
speech with these words:—“I wish to God I was going
with you!—I am sure you will do your duty—ay—and
distinguish yourselves too.” He then took leave
amidst the loud cheers of the corps.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1807</div>

<p>The expedition<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> sailed from Falmouth on the 12th of
November, 1806, and, after remaining at St. Jago, in
the Cape de Verde Islands, from the 14th of December,
1806, to the 11th of January, 1807, arrived
in Table Bay, Cape of Good Hope, on the 22nd
of March following. Here the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> landed
in marching order, and was for the first time inspected
by Brigadier-General Craufurd, who expressed
himself in terms of approbation of its general appearance.
From the Cape the expedition sailed again on the 6th
of April; called at St. Helena on the 21st, to complete
its stock of water and provisions; and, quitting that
island on the 26th, arrived on the 14th of June at <i>Monte
Video</i>, then occupied by the British troops under Lieutenant-General
Whitelocke, who had arrived there in
May, preceding, and now assumed the command of the
whole British force in South America.</p>

<p>On the 26th of June the army arrived off Ensenada
da Baragon, a port on the river Plata, about thirty-two
miles distant from Buenos Ayres, and landed on the 28th
without firing a shot. The Thirty-Sixth and <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
regiments were brigaded together under the
orders of Brigadier-General the Honourable W. Lumley.
On the 29th the troops moved forward; the light brigade,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
composed of the rifle corps and nine light infantry
companies, formed the advance, which was supported by
Brigadier-General Lumley’s brigade, and followed by the
other corps in succession. On the 1st of July the army
was concentrated near the village of Reduction, about
seven miles from Buenos Ayres, from whence it again
advanced on the following day, crossed the Chuelo, a
rivulet, by a ford called the Chico, and traversed the low
ground on the opposite bank, at the extremity of which
stands the city of <i>Buenos Ayres</i>.</p>

<p>Hitherto the enemy had offered only a very feeble resistance,
which the discharge of a few round shot was
sufficient to overcome; but when the right column, commanded
by Major-General Leveson Gower, arrived near
the Coral de Miserere, the Spaniards displayed a formidable
body of infantry and cavalry, supported by a brigade
of guns, with others in reserve. Brigadier-General
Craufurd, placing himself at the head of his brigade,
consisting of the Ninety-Fifth Rifles and light battalion,
immediately made a vigorous charge; drove the enemy
back in confusion; captured nine guns and a howitzer;
and, profiting by the panic which had seized his opponents,
pursued them into the very suburbs of the city,
where his career of victory terminated, and Major-General
Leveson Gower ordered the troops, first to halt,
and then to take up a position for the night about a mile
in the rear, near the principal slaughtering-place of the
town. During the advance into the town, Captain William
Parker Carroll, with his company, took a tilted
waggon loaded with bread, and an eight-pounder brass
gun, on which <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> was immediately scored
with the point of a soldier’s bayonet, to mark it as a
regimental prize.</p>

<p>The troops remained under arms during the night, exposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
to heavy and incessant torrents of rain. In the
morning Lieutenant-General Whitelocke summoned the
governor to surrender; the Spaniards, however, made an
attack upon the piquets, in which the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>,
which had relieved the rifle corps, lost about twenty men
killed and wounded. The assault of the town was now
determined upon, and the morning of the 5th fixed for
carrying it into execution. For this service the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
regiment was divided into wings, the right being
commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Duff, and the left by
Major Vandeleur, who were directed to enter the town
separately by two different streets, and, having gained the
banks of the river on the opposite side of the city, to
possess themselves of the houses and form on the flat
roofs; but what further steps they were to take, or what
they were to do after so forming, was not stated.</p>

<p>At half-past six o’clock on the morning of the 5th of
July the attack commenced: the right wing of the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>, formed in sections, advanced at a rapid
pace through several streets unmolested, and indeed without
encountering, or even seeing, a single human being.
A death-like silence reigned throughout the town, or was
interrupted only by the measured tread of those who
were most at a loss to comprehend the meaning of the
apparent solitude and desertion that surrounded them.
At length a few detached shots seemed to give a prearranged
signal, at which the entire population of a vast
town was to burst from its concealment, and in an instant
the flat roofs of the houses swarmed with a mass of musqueteers,
who poured a deadly, and almost unerring, fire
upon the British soldiers. Under any circumstances the
combat between men exposed in an open street, and adversaries
ensconced behind the parapets of the houses on
each side, must have been an unequal one; but the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
troops were for some time absolutely defenceless in the
midst of their enemies, having been positively ordered
to advance with unloaded arms.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Duff, however, penetrated as far
as a church on the right-hand side of the street in which
his column had been directed to establish itself; but the
strength of the barricadoed doors defied all attempts to
force an entrance. His situation now became desperate;
to remain stationary was to expose himself and his little
band to certain massacre, unmitigated even by the being
able to sell their lives dearly; to advance was nearly as
pregnant with destruction; and even returning, independent
of the repugnance every British officer feels
to the very idea of retreat, was “as bad as to go on.”
Lieutenant-Colonel Duff’s resolution was as prompt
as the necessity was urgent; he made up his mind, on
the instant, to hazard every thing while there was the
most distant chance of success, and determined to push
on; a determination which was received by his men with
shouts, and seconded by them as if every individual
soldier had felt himself personally responsible for the
issue of the contest. With the few brave companions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
that survived, he succeeded in making his way into a
cross street, and forcing open two houses, the doors of
which were not so ponderous, or so well secured as those
of the church: the houses, however, were not carried
till after a severe struggle, in which all the men that defended
them were put to death: and even when taken
they afforded the captors but little shelter, being lower
than the surrounding buildings, and, consequently, commanded
on every side. At length, after a vain and
murderous contest of four hours’ duration, but not until
the last round of ammunition was expended, Lieutenant-Colonel
Duff and his few remaining men were reduced to
the necessity of surrendering prisoners of war.</p>

<p>The left wing of the regiment, under Major Vandeleur,
had been, in the mean time, engaged in a contest equally
murderous, equally hopeless, and equally unfortunate.
It had penetrated a considerable way into one of the main
streets of the town before a single enemy appeared: two
mounted videttes were at length observed retiring slowly,
and, as they retired, constantly looking up to the tops of
the houses, evidently giving directions to the armed men,
who were as yet concealed behind the parapets. Major
Vandeleur ordered his men to advance in double-quick
time; a terrific shout now burst from behind the parapets,
and, in an instant, a dreadful fire of musketry,
accompanied by hand-grenades and other missiles, carried
death through the British ranks. Revenge or even resistance
was out of the question; nevertheless the men
remained undismayed, and continued to press on. A
deep trench with a parapet cut across the street stopped
them but for a moment; they carried it at the point of
the bayonet, though with immense loss, and, finally, surmounting
every obstacle, succeeded in reaching the river,
where they found themselves exposed to an enfilading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
fire from the guns of the citadel, at about three hundred
yards’ distance: they broke open a house, but it afforded
no protection, the yard being surrounded by other parapeted
houses, from whence an incessant and destructive
fire was poured upon them; artillery was brought against
them, and a large body of troops surrounded them in a
<i lang="fr">cul-de-sac</i>, from which either advance or retreat was impracticable.
For three hours and a half did this devoted
little band protract the hopeless struggle, and not until
they were nearly annihilated, and until the firing had
ceased on every other point, and until, like their comrades
under Colonel Duff, they had expended the last
ball cartridge that could be found even in the pouches of
their dead or dying companions, did they adopt the sad
alternative of surrender.</p>

<p>Thus ended the fatal 5th of July, 1807, the first and
only occasion on which the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> sustained a
defeat. They had the consolation, however, of knowing,
that all that men <em>could</em> do they <em>had</em> done, and of reflecting
on many individual acts of devoted bravery highly
honourable to the corps. Lieutenant Robert Nickle
(late Lieutenant-Colonel of the Thirty-Sixth) led the
advance of Brigadier-General Craufurd’s division column
into the town, and fell, dangerously wounded, after having
given repeated proofs of cool intrepidity united with the
most daring courage. Lieutenant William Mackie (now
Major, and late Captain, in the Ninety-Fourth Regiment)
was severely wounded in the thigh, but, although
fainting from loss of blood, continued at the head of his
men, until a second bullet struck him across the spine,
and stretched him, to all appearance, dead upon the
ground; contrary to every expectation, however, though
to the unfeigned delight of his comrades in arms, he
survived, to gather fresh laurels in the Peninsula. Lieutenant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
George Bury also distinguished himself by vanquishing,
in single combat, a Spanish officer of grenadiers.
Serjeant-Major William Bone, for his gallant conduct
on the same occasion, was recommended by Lieutenant-Colonel
Duff for an ensigncy, to which he was promoted,
and died a Captain in the Royal African regiment.</p>

<p>When the regiment was ordered for embarkation, Captain
Oates, who was doing duty with the first, though in
fact belonging to the second battalion, volunteered and
received the permission of his Royal Highness the Duke
of York to accompany the regiment; being a supernumerary
he was attached to the Thirty-Eighth, a company
of which he commanded in the attack on the Plaza de
Toros.</p>

<p>Some of the other divisions of the army had met with
less opposition than this regiment; the <i>Plaza de Toros</i>,
a strong post on the enemy’s right, and the <i>Residencia</i>,
a good post on their left, were taken; at the same time
part of the army had gained an advanced position opposite
the enemy’s centre; but these advantages had cost
two thousand five hundred men in killed, wounded, and
prisoners.</p>

<p>The loss of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> on this occasion
amounted to twenty officers, and two hundred and
twenty non-commissioned officers and privates killed and
wounded.</p>

<p class="p1">On the following morning Lieutenant-General Whitelocke
consented, at the instance of the Spanish commander,
to desist from further hostilities, and to evacuate the
place, on condition of having the captured regiments released.</p>

<p>The conduct of the Spanish towards the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>,
after its surrender, was marked by much kindness,
and few instances occurred of officers being plundered.
Captain M‘Gregor was robbed of his gold watch
by a black soldier, but recovered it again three days
afterwards, upon pointing out the man to a Spanish
officer. The same officer was afterwards introduced by
Captain Parker Carroll, who remained in the country as
one of the British hostages, to General Liniers, and invited
by the General to breakfast. The room in which
he was received was decorated with coloured drawings of
the different corps of militia and volunteers which had
been raised within the last few months, and whose officers
appeared to be of all hues and colours, from the real jet
black to the mulatto, tawny, and even the pale mestee.
The General, who entered freely into conversation with
his guest, asked Captain M‘Gregor what he thought of
the troops by whose portraitures he was surrounded?—receiving,
of course, a complimentary answer, he replied,
“Ay, it is <em>I</em> who have done all this for them. Those
Spaniards knew nothing of military tactics until I
arrived amongst them.” He spoke in terms of high
praise of Brigadier-General Beresford, and said they were
indebted to that officer for teaching them how to defend
the town.</p>

<p>On the 10th of July the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> re-embarked
at Buenos Ayres, and descended the River Plate to
Monte Video, at which place it arrived on the 18th; on
the 8th of August it sailed with the first division of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
army for England, and, after a tedious and boisterous
passage, made Spithead on the 5th, and landed at Portsmouth
on the 8th of November, 1807. During the
voyage it lost two officers by death, Lieutenant Lawson
and Ensign Jackson.</p>

<p>In February, 1807, while the regiment was abroad
engaged in the arduous services just detailed, its Colonel,
General John Reid,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> died, and was succeeded in the
command by W. Carr Beresford, at that time Senior
Lieutenant-Colonel of the regiment, with the rank of
Colonel in the army. Such an instance of promotion is
unusual in the service at the present period, and must
be considered, therefore, as highly complimentary, not
only to Colonel Beresford, but also to the regiment of
which he had been for so many years the acting commander.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1808.</div>

<p>Soon after its arrival in England the battalion was
marched into Sussex, and from thence to Ashford in
Kent. From Ashford it was moved in the spring of
1808 to Maldon, in Essex, where it received a draft of
four hundred men from the second battalion; this detachment
had unfortunately contracted the ophthalmia
in Hilsea barracks, and, notwithstanding all the precautions
that were taken to prevent the contagion spreading,
upwards of two hundred men were in a short time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
afflicted with the disease; nor was it until towards October
that the battalion again became quite effective.</p>

<p>On the 28th of December the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> sailed
from Falmouth for the Peninsula, but encountered, in
the Bay of Biscay, a gale of three weeks’ duration, by
which the transports on board which it was embarked,
were at length forced into Cork, and detained there until
the 21st of February following. While at Cork, Colonel
Duff, to the great regret both of officers and soldiers,
quitted the regiment, in consequence of the recent death
of his uncle the Earl of Fife, and the command devolved
on Major Vandeleur.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809</div>

<p>The original destination of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> was
Cadiz, off which city it arrived on the 6th of March,
1809; but the Spanish Government refusing to receive
any British troops into the fortress, it was ordered to
Lisbon, where it landed on the 13th, and being brigaded
with the Eighty-Seventh, was marched, early in April,
to Coimbra. About this time, two of its non-commissioned
officers, Serjeant-Major Nicholas Torrence, and
Quarter-Master Serjeant William Hill, were promoted to
commissions in the Portuguese army, of which the Colonel
of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> (Lieutenant-General Beresford)
was Commander-in-Chief, with the rank of Field
Marshal.</p>

<p>When the combined British and Portuguese army
moved from Lisbon to the north of Portugal to expel
Marshal Soult from Oporto, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> was
one of the regiments attached to the Portuguese army
under Marshal Beresford, destined to act upon the Upper
Douro and in the province of Tras os Montes, and intercept
the retreat of the French. The march upon Amarante,
the passage of the Douro, and the occupation of
Oporto, are justly ranked high among the many brilliant
achievements of the Duke of Wellington: nevertheless,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
the very nature of the service in which the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
was engaged unquestionably tended to put to
severe trial the discipline of every corps employed in it.
The rapidity and length of the marches; the very unfavourable
state of the weather; the obstacles presented
by the nature of the country in the Tras os Montes,
where the men were frequently obliged to use torch-light
to avoid the risk of being dashed to pieces in the craggy
paths they were obliged to traverse; the hospitality of
the peasantry, who, totally ignorant of the imperious demands
of military duty, were loud in commiserating and
anxious to alleviate the hard fate of their deliverers thus
compelled to march through their country in such inclement
weather, and at such unseasonable hours; all
offered temptations to straggling, which it is not at all
wonderful that the men in many instances yielded to.
The best-regulated army during a campaign, even if
carried on under the most favourable circumstances,
always becomes more or less relaxed in its discipline;
and when it is considered that the wreck of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
regiment, after its capture at Buenos Ayres,
was made up by drafts from the second battalion, that
a few short months, only, were allowed it to recruit and
re-organize before it was again employed in Portugal, it
may be matter of regret, but certainly not of surprise,
that it did not form an exception to the general rule.
In fact many men were left behind, and some period of
repose was necessary to remedy these irregularities, but
that repose could not be obtained; for towards the end
of June the whole disposable British force was marched
into Spain, and on the 27th and 28th of July was fought
the battle of <span class="smcap">Talavera de la Reyna</span>.</p>

<p>The post of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>, on the first day,
was in the wood on the river Alberche, and its conduct
was much praised by Colonel Donkin, who commanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
the brigade. It retired in line under a heavy fire, protecting
by its steady front the advanced troops, who were
greatly out-numbered by the enemy. During the retreat
the soldiers were forbidden to fire unless they could
<em>cover their man</em>. Corporal Thomas Kelly, of the fourth
company, was the first who pulled a trigger; going up
to the Adjutant, Lieutenant Stewart, and pointing out a
French officer, he said, “Do you see that officer standing
by the olive-tree in front of me? He is a dangerous
man, and has been giving directions to his soldiers that
<em>won’t sarve us</em>; four of the company have been hit
already, but if you will allow me I think I could <em>do for
him</em>.” “Try, then, Kelly,” was the reply;—he fired;
the French officer fell, and the men, disconcerted by the
loss of their leader, ceased to harass the regiment, which
continued its retreat through the wood, and took post
upon a hill on the left of the allied army, which was the
key of the position. The hill was steep and rugged
towards the enemy, but on the other side it was of
smoother ascent; the French, however, resolved to attack
this post.</p>

<p>The sun was set, and the shades of night had
gathered over the hostile armies, when suddenly a body
of French troops was seen advancing boldly to the attack,
and in an instant the regiments were engaged in a sharp
conflict. Colonel Donkin’s brigade beat the enemy in
front, and the Twenty-Ninth Regiment, by a gallant
charge, drove back part of the Ninth French Regiment.
The enemy returned to the attack; the fighting became
vehement; “and in the darkness the opposing flashes of
the musketry showed with what a spirit the struggle
was maintained: the combatants were scarcely twenty
yards asunder, and for a time the event seemed doubtful;
but soon the well-known shout of the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
soldier was heard, rising above the din of arms, and the
enemy’s broken troops were driven once more into the
ravine below.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The fighting now ceased; and the
bivouac fires blazed up on both sides.</p>

<p>At day-break on the 28th the combat was renewed; a
burst of artillery rattled round the height and swept
away the English by whole sections; the roar of musketry
succeeded, and the hill sparkled with fire. At
length, unable to sustain the increasing fury of the British,
and having lost above fifteen hundred men in the space
of forty minutes, the French retired in disorder to their
own lines.</p>

<p>About two o’clock the enemy again advanced; their
commander “gave the signal for battle, and eighty pieces
of artillery immediately sent a tempest of bullets before
the light troops, who, coming on with the swiftness and
violence of a hail-storm, were closely followed by the
broad black columns in all the majesty of war. The
English regiments, putting the French skirmishers
aside, met the advancing columns with loud shouts,
and breaking in on their front, and lapping their flanks
with fire, and giving them no respite, pushed them
back with a terrible carnage.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The attack was, however,
soon renewed; a fierce conflict raged along the
whole front, and the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> nobly maintained
its post on the hill on the left; it had no opportunity of
gaining distinction in close fight, but displayed great
steadiness in sustaining a heavy fire of artillery. The
French at length relaxed their efforts, the fire of the
British grew hotter, and their loud and confident shouts—sure
augury of success—were heard along the whole
line; finally the French retreated without venturing
another attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span></p>

<p>The loss of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> in killed and wounded
amounted to six officers and one hundred and thirty non-commissioned
officers and privates. The officers were
Captains Blake, Graydon, and Whittle, and Lieutenant
M‘Carthy killed; and Captain Browne and Lieutenant
Whitelaw wounded.</p>

<p>In the movement upon Almaraz the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
joined Brigadier-General Craufurd’s brigade. In this
position, very appropriately named by the soldiers
“Hungry Hill,” it suffered much from the tardy and
defective supply of rations; a situation the more trying
to the men from its contrast to the exuberant plenty they
had recently enjoyed in the north of Portugal. Subsequently,
the regiment occupied, for some time, the town
of Campo Mayor, where Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander
Wallace joined and took the command of the battalion,
which received, also, a detachment of three hundred men
from the second battalion. Advantage was immediately
taken of the regiments becoming, even for a short time
stationary, to commence a system of drilling necessary
for the re-establishment of that discipline which, during
the incessant activity of the preceding months, had unavoidably
been somewhat neglected. The task required
great zeal and firmness, activity and energy; but Lieutenant-Colonel
Wallace showed himself fully competent
to it, and had the satisfaction and honour of rendering his
corps, what it afterwards was acknowledged to be, one of
the finest service regiments in the Peninsular army. At
Campo Mayor, also, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> set the example,
which was speedily followed by other regiments, of forming
a regimental mess; indeed, a marked friendliness and
cordiality reigned throughout the corps.</p>

<p>About this time Major Vandeleur died,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and Colonel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
Donkin, who commanded the brigade, quitted the army,
addressing previous to his departure a letter to Colonel
Wallace, from which the following are extracts:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The distinguished bravery of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
Regiment at Talavera, I shall ever reflect upon with
admiration; and this splendid quality has been set off,
first, by the utmost patience under the greatest fatigues
and privations, and latterly, by the most exemplary
behaviour while in a state of repose.</p>

<p>“I request you will be pleased to accept for yourself
and your gallant corps, my warmest acknowledgments
and best wishes, and convey to it my sincere assurance
that should the chance of service ever place it again
under my command, it will be one of the highest gratifications
that I can receive.”</p>
</div>

<p>Towards the end of the year (1809), the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
removed from Campo Mayor, and occupied the
town of Pinhel in the province of Beira: it was brigaded
with the Forty-Fifth and Seventy-Fourth, under Colonel
Henry Mackinnon, and formed part of the third (or what
was afterwards known by the appellation of the “fighting”)
division of the army commanded by Lieutenant-General
Picton.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810</div>

<p>The advance of Marshal Massena in the summer of
1810, preceded by the proud but vain boast, that in pursuance
of the Imperial orders he would drive the English
leopards into the sea, and plant the eagles of France on
the towers of Lisbon; the successes with which his first
operations were attended; the reduction one after another
of Ciudad Rodrigo and Almeida, belong to the general
history of the Peninsular war, into which the particular
memoirs of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> regiment must glide on
to the night of the 26th of September, the eve of the
battle of <span class="smcap">Busaco</span>.</p>

<p>On that night the combined British and Portuguese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
armies were assembled in line, on the ridge of a lofty and
precipitous range of hills, taking its denomination from
the village and convent of Busaco. The Second division,
under Lieutenant-General Hill, formed the right;
the Light division, commanded by Brigadier-General
Craufurd, was posted on the left near the convent; the
Third division was in the centre, while the Fourth, Fifth,
and Sixth occupied the intermediate spaces, and the First,
together with the cavalry, were in reserve in the rear of
the left. In their front, within little more than half a
cannon shot distance, lay the army of Massena. The
weather was calm and fine, and the dark mountains rising
on either side were crowned with innumerable fires. The
French were apparently all bustle and gaiety, and following
their usual avocations with as much <span lang="fr">sang froid</span> as if
employed in preparing for a review, not a battle. Along
the whole British line not a fire was to be seen; the soldiers
in stern silence, examined their flints, cleaned their
locks and barrels, and then stretched themselves on the
ground to rest, each with his firelock within his grasp.
In their rear, unsheltered by any covering but his cloak,
lay their distinguished leader. During the night the
French light troops, dropping by twos and threes into
the lowest part of the valley, endeavoured to ascend the
woody dells and hollows, and establish themselves near
the British piquets.</p>

<p>An hour before day on the 27th of September, Lord
Wellington passed through the ranks on foot. He passed
in comparative silence, for the English soldiers seldom
indulge in those boisterous demonstrations of joy so common
with the troops of other nations, and indeed rarely
are known to huzza, except when closing with the enemy;
but wherever he was recognised, his presence was felt as
the sure presage of another victory, to be gained by the
men whom he had already led in so many fields of triumph.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
To be beaten when <em>He</em> commanded, seemed, in
the opinion of his soldiers, next to impossible. As the
light appeared, the fire of musketry commenced in the
deep hollows which separated the two armies. Shortly
afterwards two French columns, throwing forward a cloud
of skirmishers, emerged from the hollow beneath.</p>

<p>On the left, Marshal Ney advanced against the Light
division under Brigadier-General Craufurd, and, in spite
of the fire of the riflemen, broke through all opposition,
and mounted the crest of the ridge, to remain there, however,
only for a moment, before the bayonets of the
Forty-Third, Fifty-Second, and Ninety-Fifth drove him
down again in confusion, leaving the ground covered
with dead and wounded, and the French General Simon,
who led the attack, together with many other officers and
soldiers, prisoners.</p>

<p>In the mean time the left centre of the British army
was assailed with equal impetuosity by the second corps
of Massena’s army under General Reynier. The disposition
of the Third division was as follows:—four companies
of the Forty-Fifth and <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> occupied
the crest of the hill to the left; the Seventy-Fourth was
considerably to the right of these two battalions, the
Eighth Portuguese a little to the right and rear, the
Fifth and Eighty-Third British were to the left of all,
and the Ninth and Twenty-First Portuguese on a
rising ground to the right of the division. Major-General
Lightburne and Colonel Mackinnon commanded
the two British Brigades, and Colonel Champelmond
the Portuguese, the whole division being under
the orders of Major-General Picton. Lord Wellington,
stationed on a rising ground near the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>,
had a full view of these dispositions.</p>

<p>The advance of Reynier’s corps was made with the
impetuous rush on which the French troops so much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
depend, and a crowd of sharp-shooters pressed forward in
front of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>; Lieutenant-Colonel Wallace
saw he was about to be attacked by a column;
a misty cloud had settled on the mountain, and he sent
Captain Dunne to observe the movements of the enemy
on his right, which was a little exposed.</p>

<p>The light troops, after a severe struggle, succeeded in
driving back the enemy, but were repulsed themselves in
turn. Lieutenant-Colonel Wallace with the utmost
coolness, took two men from each of his battalion companies,
and placing them under the command of Lieutenant
Mackie, reinforced the advance, and thus for some time
again kept the French in check; at length, however, they
were compelled to retire before the overwhelming force
that pressed upon them. The situation was in the
highest degree critical, and demanded decision and coolness;
the French light troops were rushing on with loud
shouts, closely followed by a column of infantry; General
Picton was not within reach at the instant, and the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> was without orders. At this moment
Colonel Wallace addressed his men.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The time so long wished for by you and by me is at
length arrived; you have now an opportunity of distinguishing
yourselves. Be cool, be steady, but above
all, pay attention to my word of command—you know
it well. You see how these Frenchmen press on; let
them do so; when they reach a little nearer us I will
order you to advance to that mount—look at it lest
you might mistake what I say. Now, mind what I
tell you; when you arrive at that spot, I will charge,
and I have now only to add, <em>the rest</em> must be done by
yourselves—press on them to the muzzle—I say, <span class="smcap">Connaught
Rangers</span>! press on the rascals!”</p>
</div>

<p>This animating address was received by the men, not
with shouts and hurrahs, but still better, with a deep and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
silent attention, indicating firmness of decision and earnestness
of purpose.</p>

<p>The regiment was drawn up in line, and many men
had already fallen; the colours carried by Ensigns
Joseph Owgan and William Grattan, were pierced by
numerous bullets, and three of the colour-serjeants were
wounded, when Captain Dunne returned, and reported
to Colonel Wallace, that besides the mass in his front,
which was only the advance of a column about to assail
him, a body of riflemen had occupied a cluster of rocks on
the right of the regiment, and the main body of the enemy
was moving towards an open space which separated the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> from the Forty-Fifth regiment. Cool
and unruffled amongst the dangers that surrounded him,
Lieutenant-Colonel Wallace asked Captain Dunne if he
thought half the battalion would be sufficient to do the
business. “No,” was the reply, “you will want every
man you can bring forward.” “Very well,” said Colonel
Wallace, “I am ready—Soldiers; mind what I
have said to you—I have nothing more to add—it now
rests with yourselves.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Wallace then threw the battalion
into column right in front, but had scarcely reached the
rocks, when a murderous fire was opened upon him;
without losing his presence of mind for a moment, he filed
the grenadiers and two battalion companies out of the
column, ordering them to carry the rocks at all hazards,
while with the remainder of the battalion he pressed on
against the main body of the enemy.</p>

<p>The Eighth Portuguese regiment had not yet opened
its fire; it was too distant: four companies of the Forty-Fifth
were engaged in an unequal combat, bravely but
ineffectually disputing every inch of ground with a far
superior force by which they were assailed: their brave
commander, Major Gwynne, had already fallen, and these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
companies were on the very brink of being annihilated,
when the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> rushed to their assistance, and
the two corps precipitated themselves into the midst of
the French column, consisting of their Second, Fourth,
and Thirty-Sixth regiments, and Irish brigade, and forming
the advance of Reynier’s division; they received one
dreadful discharge of musketry, but only one; before a
second could be thrown in, they had passed through the
French column, and completely overthrowing it, drove it
down the mountain side with a mighty clamour and confusion,
covering the ground with the dead and dying,
even to the bottom of the valley.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the three companies of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
which had been detached to drive the French
riflemen from the rocks on the right, had been engaged
in a severe and desperate struggle. In the advance they
were exposed to the deliberate aim of practised marksmen
ranged amphitheatrically rank above rank, and protected
by the rocks of which they had just taken possession;
arrived at the point of contest, both officers and men
were soon engaged in a hand-to-hand fight. The French
defended themselves with more than usual desperation,
for they were aware that escape was out of the question,
and that they had no alternative between repelling their
assailants and being slain on the spot, or hurled headlong
down the precipitous rocks on which they had established
themselves. Twenty minutes, however, sufficed to decide
the question, and to teach the heroes of Marengo and
Austerlitz<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> that, with every advantage of position on
their side, they must yield to the <em>Rangers of Connaught</em>.</p>

<p>During this short but arduous conflict Captain Dansey
was severely wounded, and Captain Dunne had a hair-breadth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
escape of swelling the return of killed. He had
made a cut with his sabre at one of the French riflemen,
but struck short, the man being above the reach of his
weapon; the Frenchman’s bayonet, on the other hand,
was within a few inches of Captain Dunne’s breast, and
his finger on the trigger; one word was shouted by Captain
Dunne—it was the name of a serjeant in the regiment,
“<span class="smcap">Brazel</span>!” He heard the call through all the
din of battle, and rushing forwards, although he fell upon
his face in making the lunge, buried his halberd in the
Frenchman’s body, and rescued his officer from certain
death.</p>

<p>Lord Wellington, who had been a near spectator of
the achievements of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>, bestowed the
warmest encomiums on the regiment. He galloped up
to it, and taking Lieutenant-Colonel Wallace by the
hand, said, “Wallace, I never saw a more gallant charge
than that just now made by your regiment.” In his
public despatches he repeated the expressions of approbation
which he had used during the heat of the combat,
as the following extracts will show:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“One division of French infantry arrived at the top of
the ridge, when it was attacked in the most gallant
manner by the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> Regiment, under the
command of Lieutenant-Colonel Wallace.”... “In
these attacks Lieutenant-Colonel Wallace, &amp;c. &amp;c.,
distinguished themselves.”... “I have also to mention
in a particular manner, the conduct of Captain
Dansey of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> Regiment.”...
“And I beg to assure your Lordship, that I never witnessed
a more gallant attack than that made by the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>, Forty-Fifth, and Eighth Portuguese
regiments, on the enemy’s division which reached the
ridge of the Sierra.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span></p>

<p>The Colonel of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>, Marshal Beresford,
joined in the praises bestowed upon his regiment,
and recognised the faces of some of the veteran soldiers
who had served in India, Egypt, and South America:
these men crowded around him with that affectionate
familiarity which the high-wrought feelings of such a
moment, the sense of a community in past dangers, from
which rank gave no protection, and a companionship in
present safety, sometimes permitted even from the private
soldier to the general.</p>

<p>The cluster of rocks, so lately the scene of deadly
conflict, presented a singular spectacle even to those
whom use had familiarized with such sights. At their
foot many of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> were stretched on the
field, while in the chasms were to be seen numerous
Frenchmen still in the very attitude in which death had
overtaken them; some reclining backwards against a crag
as if asleep, others leaning forwards over a projecting
stone, as in the act of firing; while at the foot of the precipice,
on the further side, were many who had been
dashed to pieces in their vain endeavours to escape.</p>

<p>The instances of individual bravery displayed by the
officers and men of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> at <i>Busaco</i> were
numerous. Colonel Wallace, finding the charger on
which he was mounted at the commencement of the day,
was terrified by the firing, and reared frequently, at once
abandoned his horse, and fought for some time on foot at
the head of his men. Captain Dansey, who commanded
one of the companies that attacked the rocks, and who
was severely wounded, distinguished himself so as not
only to obtain the immediate commendation of his Colonel
and the admiration of his comrades, but was also particularly
noticed in the despatches of the Commander-in-Chief.
Lieutenant William Mackie, to whom Lieutenant-Colonel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
Wallace confided the command of the battalion-men
sent early in the day to support the light infantry,
displayed all the courage and coolness necessary in so
critical a moment; he was frequently nearly surrounded
by the enemy, but escaped unhurt, and, on rejoining the
regiment, was loudly cheered by the men. Lieutenant
Heppenstall, a young officer, whose first appearance
under fire was on this occasion, was frequently mixed
with the enemy’s riflemen, and shot two of them, one an
officer. Lieutenant William Nickle, serving with the
light company, was deliberately singled out by a Frenchman
whose third shot passed through his body, but without
killing him; as he was proceeding to the rear the
same Frenchman sent a fourth shot after him, which
knocked off his cap, cheering at the same time. “Get
on, Nickle,” said Heppenstall, “I’ll stop that fellow’s
crowing.” He waited quietly till the man approached
within sure distance, and then revenged his wounded
comrade by shooting the Frenchman dead. Corporal
Thomas Kelly, of the fourth company, (the same man
who shot the French officer in the retreat through the
wood near the Alberche at Talavera,) was severely
wounded in the thigh at the commencement of the charge
against the French column, but continued to run with
his company down the hill, until he fell through exhaustion
and loss of blood.</p>

<p>The loss of the regiment at Busaco amounted to nine
officers and one hundred and twenty-four non-commissioned
officers and privates killed and wounded. The
officers killed were Major Silver, Lieutenant H. Johnston,
and Ensign Leonard; the wounded, Major Macgregor,
Captains Dansey, M‘Dermot, and Bury; and
Lieutenants Fitzpatrick and Nickle.</p>

<p>Unable to overcome the allied army in combat, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
French commander turned its flank; when Lord
Wellington retired to the celebrated lines of <span class="smcap">Torres
Vedras</span>, where he opposed a resistance which compelled
the French Marshal, notwithstanding his superior numbers,
to relinquish his design upon Lisbon. The <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
formed part of the troops which occupied the town
and lines of Torres Vedras. The weather was unusually
wet, and the army being but indifferently supplied with
the materials necessary for the construction of good huts,
suffered much from the inclemency of the season; yet,
notwithstanding the fatigues of the severe campaign it
had gone through, the unfavourableness of the weather
to health, and the living principally on salted provisions,
of which the rations served out to the army chiefly consisted,
the regiment continued in the most effective state.
The French, however, suffered much greater privations,
and eventually they were forced to retire.</p>

<p>On the 14th of November, Marshal Massena (Prince
of Esling) left his position during the night, and took the
road to Santarem. This operation was performed under
cover of a dark and stormy night, and the enemy effectually
succeeded in deceiving the British piquets by substituting
<em>straw figures</em>, in place of his veteran tirailleurs,
admirably appointed with caps and accoutrements, and
by this ruse succeeded in effecting his movement without
loss; verifying an old remark, that “<em>men of straw</em>,” by
putting on a good appearance, often deceive their neighbours.</p>

<p>The allied army moved forward; the head-quarters
were established at Cartago, and the third division occupied
the village of Togarro. The French commander
was subsequently forced to retire from his position.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811</div>

<p>In the pursuit of Massena towards the frontiers of
Portugal, the Third division was not much engaged with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
the enemy, but the continual marches to turn the flanks
of the French army subjected it to great fatigue. In the
course of these marches and constant skirmishes, the regiment
lost a most intelligent and enterprising officer,
Lieutenant Heppenstall, already mentioned; he fell in
the action of <span class="smcap">Foz-d’Aronce</span>, on the 15th of March,
1811. He was buried at the foot of a pine, near the spot
where he fell, under the direction of Dr. Arthur Stewart.</p>

<p>In the action at <i>Sabugal</i>, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>, though
present, was not actually engaged, a severe storm of
snow and hail, which fell just at the moment the Third
division, having issued from the woods on the enemy’s
right, was about to charge, completely hiding the French
corps (General Reynier’s) from view, and giving its
commander an opportunity of retiring unattacked.</p>

<p>On the first two days of <i>Fuentes d’Onor</i>, it was in position,
but on the third and decisive day of that glorious
battle it had a brilliant opportunity of distinguishing itself,
and earning another honorary inscription for its colours.</p>

<p>The village of <i>Fuentes d’Onor</i>, which is situated on
some low ground, with an old chapel and a few buildings
on a craggy eminence at one end, had been the scene of a
long, protracted, and sanguinary contest on the 3rd of
May; the lower part of the village had been several
times taken and retaken, and during the night each
army occupied that part of the village which had remained
in its possession when darkness and mutual exhaustion
put a temporary stop to the battle. The following
day was wholly passed in reconnoitering and
manœuvres; the British force in Fuentes d’Onor was
considerably reinforced from the First division, and
amongst other regiments sent to aid in its defence were
the Seventy-First and Seventy-Ninth. Soon after day-break
on the 5th, the attack was recommenced by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
French with increased numbers and renewed fury. Lord
Wellington observing the serious efforts of Massena upon
this point, and fully appreciating its importance, ordered
the Twenty-Fourth, Forty-Fifth, Seventy-Fourth, and
<span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> British, together with the Ninth and
Twenty-First Portuguese regiments, to its support.</p>

<p>It was now about half-past twelve o’clock; the combat
in the village had lasted without intermission for eight
hours during a day of oppressive heat, and our ammunition
was nearly expended. The Highlanders were
driven to the church-yard at the top of the town, where
they were fighting with the French grenadiers over the
tomb-stones and graves, while the Ninth French light
infantry had penetrated as far as the chapel, only a short
distance from our line, and were preparing to <span lang="fr">débouche</span>
upon our centre. Lord Wellington was on the spot, and
surveyed what was passing with the immovable coolness
which always characterized him; the troops in the town
were nearly worn out in the contest and about to retire,
when the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> was ordered to their support,
and changed the face of affairs. Colonel the Honourable
Edward Pakenham, who was in the hottest of the fire,
had inquired what regiments were in reserve; and when
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> was named amongst others, asked,
“Is Wallace with the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>?” and on being
replied to in the affirmative, said, “Tell him to come
down then, and drive these fellows back; he will do
the thing properly.”</p>

<p>The battalion was ordered to advance in column of
sections, left in front, in double-quick time. As it
passed down the road leading to the chapel it was warmly
cheered by the troops lying at each side the wall, but the
soldiers gave no cheer, no reply; they were placed, and
they felt it, in a situation of great distinction; they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
about to fight not only under the eye of their own general
and his army, but in full view, also, of the French
army; their feelings were wound up to the highest pitch
of enthusiasm, but there was no huzzaing, no noise, or
talking in the ranks; the men, headed by their brave
Colonel, stepped together at a smart pace under a very
heavy fire of artillery and musketry, as steady and as
silent as if on parade. The company which led this
attack was commanded by Ensign William Grattan.
When they came within sight of the French Ninth regiment,
which was drawn up at the corner of the chapel
ready to receive them, he turned round to observe the
state of his men; the soldiers understood his look and
action, and replied to it by a cheer, the first they had
given, and which, so given, showed plainly that their
hearts were in a right state.</p>

<p>The enemy had not remained idle spectators of this
movement; a battery of eight pounders advanced at a
gallop on the opposite side of the river, and opened a
heavy fire on the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>, hoping to annihilate
it, or at least to check its progress and cripple its efforts,
but the battalion, regardless of the grape which was
showered upon it, continued to press on, and, in fact,
suffered but slightly from the cannonade to which it
was exposed. Arrived within a few yards of the chapel
they were met by the Ninth French regiment, supported
by some hundreds of the Imperial Guard, who rushed on
with their usual impetuosity and bravery, uttering loud
shouts and throwing in their fire as they advanced; the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> replied with the bayonet, and rapidly
closing with their enemies, so totally overthrew them,
that they were not able to rally afterwards. The exhausted
but brave troops that had been so seriously
engaged all the morning, now joined in the pursuit, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
in less than fifteen minutes from the time the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
commenced its attack there was not a French
combatant in the village: their whole force was driven
across the rivulet, and many of the British in their pursuit
fell on the French side of the stream.</p>

<p>About one hundred and fifty of the Old French Guard
in their flight ran down a street which was one of the few
that had escaped the fury of the morning attack, and the
further end of which, unknown to them, had been barricaded
by our troops the night before. Shut up thus in
a complete <i lang="fr">cul-de-sac</i>, the result may be easily imagined;—it
was a frightful slaughter, but it was unavoidable.
Troops advancing to assault a town, flushed, indeed, with
victory, but uncertain whether that victory may not be
wrenched the next minute from their grasp, have no
time to deliberate. Some of the French Guard sought a
vain refuge in bursting open the houses and ascending the
chimneys, but their enemies were too close at their heels
for them to succeed. This attack was headed by Lieutenant
George Johnston, who, not satisfied with clearing
one street, immediately proceeded to the next, where the
enemy still made a show of resistance, and at length carried
away by feelings very natural at such a moment, he
climbed up to the top of a stone cross, erected in a square
at the river’s edge, and taking off his hat waved it in defiance
towards the enemy. The French, however, made
no further effort to recover the place, but confined themselves
to a heavy cannonade which they continued to
pour into the streets, utterly regardless of its murderous
effects upon their own wounded. From this cannonade
the men of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> were ordered by Colonel
the Honourable Edward Pakenham to shelter themselves,
when they took a position behind a wall in the rear of
the chapel, and soon afterwards evacuated the town,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
which was occupied by the light division under Brigadier-General
Robert Craufurd.</p>

<p>When the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> was ordered by Colonel
Mackinnon to resume its place in brigade, the enemy’s
fire had ceased, but as soon as they were seen in motion,
it recommenced with double fury; the wall was knocked
down in several places, and one round shot passed between
Colonel Pakenham and Lieutenant-Colonel Wallace,
who were on horseback close to each other. It carried
away the top of the wall, one of the stones striking
Lieutenant-Colonel Wallace on the head and knocking
his hat off, but doing him no further injury, though, for
the moment, his men believed he had been killed. The
regiment then quitted the place by companies in file as
the safest way to avoid the effects of the cannonade: the
companies returned, left in front. Colonel Pakenham,
with his hat shot through the leaf, and his hand wrapped
up in a pocket handkerchief, called out to Ensign Grattan
as he passed at the head of the foremost company, to
know where he was going, and why he left the village.
Being told that it was in consequence of orders from
Colonel Mackinnon, Colonel Pakenham replied, “I did
not observe your <em>number</em>. Do as you are directed;
your regiment has done enough for this day; but you
may tell whatever troops you meet, that each man may
as well bring a keg of ammunition under his arm, for
those rascals shall never get possession of the town as
long as I have life.” By four o’clock in the afternoon
the regiment had joined its brigade.</p>

<p>The conduct of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> at Fuentes d’Onor
(as at Busaco) obtained the particular notice of Lord
Wellington, who, in his despatch containing the account
of that battle, says, “On one of these occasions, the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>, with the Seventy-First and Seventy-Ninth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
under the command of Colonel Mackinnon,
charged the enemy, and drove them through the village.
Colonel Mackinnon has reported particularly
the conduct of Lieutenant-Colonel Wallace and Lieutenant
and Adjutant Stewart of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
regiment.”</p>

<p>The loss of the regiment was not so great as might
have been expected from the brilliancy and seriousness
of the affair in which it had been engaged. This comparatively
small loss is to be attributed to the great
steadiness and regularity of the men in their different
attacks, and to the rapidity with which, on all occasions,
they closed with their adversaries. Only one officer,
Captain Irwin, was killed, and four wounded, <em>viz.</em> Lieutenants
Stewart, Macalpin, and Halket, and Ensign
Owgan. Of non-commissioned officers and privates,
seven were killed and fifty-three wounded.</p>

<p>For a few days after the battle of Fuentes d’Onor, the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> occupied the village of Navez de Aver,
and was then ordered to the south to join the forces engaged
in the siege of Badajoz. No opportunity occurred
during this siege for the regiment to distinguish itself as
a body, but many detached instances of intrepidity were
displayed by the men as circumstances gave them an opportunity.
Amongst others, on the day before the first
assault on St. Christoval (the 5th of June), Private Edmund
Man, of the grenadier company, was employed in
repairing a damaged embrasure in one of the batteries
against the castle. He was sitting outside the embrasure,
pegging in a fascine, when Colonel Fletcher, the
commanding engineer, who, though fearless of any danger
as far as regarded himself, was particularly tenacious of
allowing the soldiers to expose themselves unnecessarily,
called to him, “Come in, my fine fellow, and you will do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
your work as well, or nearly so at all events.” “It’s
hardly worth while, Colonel,” replied Man, “I am just
finished, and they cannot hit me, for they have been
trying it hard this quarter of an hour.” The words
were scarcely out of the brave fellow’s mouth, when a
round shot cut him in two, the French cannoniers cheering
loudly at the same time at the accuracy of their
practice.</p>

<p>When the siege of Badajoz was raised in the month of
June, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> proceeded to quarters in
Campo Mayor, where the second battalion, which had
joined the army on the advance from the lines of Torres
Vedras, was drafted into the first, making it a fine effective
corps, numbering upwards of one thousand bayonets.
The staff of the second battalion then returned to England
to recruit.</p>

<p>In the autumn of this year the regiment was selected
to support the outposts of the army against the attacks
of the French garrison of Ciudad Rodrigo, and was cantoned
in the villages of El Bodon, La Encina, and Pastores.
The French had been in the habit of plundering
the country around, and successful in several of their
excursions previous to the arrival of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>.
A few nights after the regiment occupied Pastores, its
outposts were attempted by a party from the garrison,
which was immediately repulsed with loss, and its commander
killed on the spot by Corporal John Walsh of
the light infantry company. It was the first and also the
last attempt the enemy made on the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
during its stay in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The blockade of Ciudad Rodrigo was completed on
the 5th of September, and preparations for the siege
commenced, when the junction of Marshal Marmont and
Count Dorsenne obliged Lord Wellington to abandon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
the design for a time. On the 25th of the same
month, the third division was attacked at El Bodon by
General Montbrun, and fell back upon Fuente Guinaldo,
in good order and with little loss, although the distance
was eight miles, and the retreat was made in the face of
a powerful artillery and cavalry force. The <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
suffered but slightly in this affair, and occupied
for its winter-quarters, or rather quarters of repose, the
village of Aldea da Ponte.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1812</div>

<p>In the depth of the ensuing winter the army was suddenly
called from its cantonments to the siege of <i>Ciudad
Rodrigo</i>, the investment of which fortress was effected on
the 8th of January, 1812. The service of the trenches
was carried on by the first, third, fourth, and light divisions
alternately, each taking the duty for four-and-twenty
hours. The weather was severe, and the troops without
covering, but the men were in high health and spirits,
and the siege was prosecuted with so much vigour, that
on the 19th of the same month, two practicable breaches
having been made in the body of the place, Lord Wellington
determined to carry it by storm.</p>

<p>The third and light divisions had the honour to be
selected for this service; the latter was directed to attack
the left or smaller breach, while the assault of the grand
breach was confided to the former. The fourth division
was in reserve. It was half-past six in the evening when
the orders for storming the town arrived; Colonel Wallace
was absent from the army on account of ill-health,
and the command of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> devolved upon
Major Thompson. A few minutes before the brigade was
formed for the attack, Major-General Mackinnon sent for
Major Thompson, and told him, he wished the forlorn
hope to be led by a subaltern officer of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>;
adding, that in the event of such officer surviving,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
he should be recommended for, and as a matter
of course would obtain, a company. Major Thompson
felt the distinguished compliment to the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
which this intimation of the General’s wish conveyed,
and calling his officers together, informed them of it.
Lieutenant William Mackie, then <em>senior-lieutenant</em>, instantly
stepped forward, and dropping his sword, said,
“Major, I am ready for that service.” “Go then,”
replied the Major, taking him by the hand, “Go, and
God bless you!” The soldiers, who were close at hand,
heard what passed, and some difficulty arose in selecting,
out of the numbers who pressed forward claiming on
some pretence or other the preference in danger, the
twenty to which the Forlorn Hope was limited. The selection,
however, was quickly made from the company
which Lieutenant Mackie commanded.</p>

<p>The regiment was formed in sections, right in front,
and everything in readiness to obey the signal gun for
the advance, when Lieutenant-General Picton and Major-General
Mackinnon appeared accompanied by their staff.
Long harangues are seldom made to British soldiers, and
in the present instance Lieutenant-General Picton’s words
were few, but at the same time too animating, and too
characteristic of himself, not to be recorded verbatim.
They were, “<span class="smcap">Rangers of Connaught</span>! It is not my
intention to expend any powder this evening: we will
do this business with the cold iron.”</p>

<p>The troops then entered the trenches with Major-General
Mackinnon at their head; on leaving the approaches
they advanced rapidly over the rugged ground leading
to the breach, many of the men carrying bags filled with
grass to throw into the ditch and break the descent. Arrived
at the foot of the breach they speedily mounted,
but met with a very gallant resistance, and many men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
and officers fell: amongst the latter was the commander
of the Brigade, Major-General Mackinnon, who was
killed with many others by an explosion of gunpowder in
the moment of victory. On each side the breach was
a twenty-four pounder, every discharge from which
swept it with a raking fire. Major Thompson of the
Seventy-Fourth (acting engineer), observing the destruction
occasioned by these guns, ordered the few men who
were next at hand to storm the one on the left; the
nearest men happened to be three of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>,
Brazel, who saved Captain Dunne’s life at Busaco, Kelly
and Swan. Beneath them and the gun was a deep retrenchment,
which would have rendered it impossible for
them to reach it in time to anticipate its next fatal discharge,
if they were encumbered with their firelocks.
Without a moment’s hesitation they threw aside the
heavier weapon, and armed only with their bayonets,
leaped the interposing barrier, rushed up to the muzzle
of the piece, and after a short but terrific combat (in
which Swan lost his arm by the stroke of a sabre) put all
the French cannoniers to death and silenced the gun.
The troops on the breach were now safe from the havock
which had a few minutes before been so fatal to their
comrades, and in half an hour the town was carried.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Mackie, guided by the fugitives of the
garrison, was the first to arrive with his party at the
gates of the citadel, where the enemy inquired for a General
Officer to receive their surrender. The Lieutenant
being a Grenadier officer, pointed to his epaulettes as a
guarantee of their safety in surrendering to him, and
the gate was immediately opened. The officer commanding
the advance of the light division coming up at
the moment, the governor and his staff were conducted
to Lord Wellington, who had by this time reached the
ramparts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant Faris was engaged during the assault in a
desperate hand-to-hand conflict. Two French grenadiers,
observing him far in advance of his men, attacked
him. One fired and immediately ran away, his bullet
passing through the Lieutenant’s coat; the other then
fired, wounded him slightly in the thigh, and immediately
closed upon him with the bayonet, making a thrust at
the body, which Lieutenant Faris parried with his sabre,
but received a severe wound in the leg; a personal
struggle then took place, from which Lieutenant F. at
length succeeded in disengaging himself, and killed his
adversary by a sabre cut on the head. By this time he
was completely exhausted, and was obliged to be carried
into the next house. His wounds, however, though
severe, were neither of them dangerous, and he soon
recovered.</p>

<p>The loss of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> before <i>Ciudad Rodrigo</i>
was one officer, Lieutenant Beresford, and twenty
rank and file killed; four Lieutenants, Flack, Armstrong,
Johnston, and W. Kingsmill, two serjeants, and
fifty-four rank and file wounded. Lord Wellington in
his despatches notices the third division and this regiment
in the following words,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The conduct of all parts of the Third Division in
these operations, which they performed with so much
gallantry and exactness on the evening of the 19th in
the dark, affords the strongest proofs of the abilities
of Lieutenant-General Picton and Major-General
Mackinnon, &amp;c.” And again: “It is but justice to
the third division, to report that the men who performed
the sap belonged to the Forty-Fifth, Seventy-Fourth,
and <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> Regiments.”</p>
</div>

<p>After the reduction of Ciudad Rodrigo, the regiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
occupied the village of Albergeria until the middle of
February, when it marched towards the South to join
the forces in Alentejo, and act against the fortress of <i>Badajoz</i>.
In this siege the duty of the trenches was performed
by the third, fourth, and sixth divisions, about
sixteen thousand strong, while the French garrison
amounted to six thousand. The place was invested on
the 16th of March, and the trenches opened the same
night. On the night of the 19th the garrison made a
sortie with two thousand men against the right of the
trenches with great gallantry, and at first with considerable
success, but were finally driven back to the town
with loss. In that part of the British line which faced
the advanced fort called La Picurina, were two batteries
in a forward state, occupied by a party of the Forty-Fifth
and <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>, under the command of Captain
Hogan of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>. The trenches were
in such a state from the rain which had fallen almost
incessantly from the commencement of the siege, that the
working parties were up to their knees in water, and it
was deemed right to keep the covering troops as much as
possible out of the wet ground. About half an hour
before the usual time of relieving the guard of the
trenches, Ensigns Darcy and Grattan of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>,
although the smoke of the French batteries
combined with a heavy fog rendered it impossible to distinguish
objects at any distance, thought they observed
symptoms of the enemy’s meditating a sortie from the
Picurina Fort. Without waiting for orders, they instantly
directed the working party to throw down their
tools and resume their arms; in the next moment, and
before many of the men were in readiness to act, the
French made a rush at the battery No. 2, but were received
at the point of the bayonet, by the few assembled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
men of the Forty-Fifth and <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>, and thus
the readiness and presence of mind of two young officers,
and the firmness of a handful of brave men, preserved
the half finished works from destruction. Some of the
soldiers pursued the repulsed enemy as far as the glacis
of the town, and two privates of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>,
Kelly of the fourth company (who has been already mentioned
for his conduct at Talavera, Busaco, and Ciudad
Rodrigo) and M‘Gowan of the grenadiers particularly
distinguished themselves.</p>

<p>On the 24th the regiment lost one Lieutenant (North)
killed, and had another Lieutenant (Stewart) wounded,
by the fire of the place. On the evening of the 25th it
was determined to storm the Picurina redoubt; five hundred
men of the third division were ordered upon that
duty, and amongst them a detachment of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>,
commanded by Captain Oates and Lieutenant
George Johnston. The latter officer was a volunteer; it
was not his tour of duty in the trenches, and he still
carried his arm in a sling from the effects of his wound
at Ciudad Rodrigo; but the moment he heard that Captain
Oates, who was the Captain of his company, was to
be of the storming party, he determined to join him.
The first attack was made at the gorge of the redoubt,
but the defences were too strong and the resistance too
obstinate even for troops accustomed to victory; repulsed
there, however, and with severe loss, they did not abandon
the attack in despair; gliding round the flanks and
faces of the work, they sought for, and at length obtained,
an entry by scaling the ramparts. In one of these attempts
the ladders proving too short, Captain Oates observing
that the ditch though very deep was narrow,
called out, “Come, boys, though the ladders are too short
to mount <em>up</em> the ditch, let us try our hand with them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
across it.” In a few minutes three ladders were pitched
from the glacis into the mouth of an embrasure, and
across them, in spite of a severe fire of musketry and
grape. Captain Oates led the way into the redoubt; here
he soon fell, disabled by a severe wound, and Lieutenant
Johnston was killed within a few paces of him; in fact,
of fifteen officers who were with the party not one escaped
unhurt.</p>

<p>During the further progress of the siege, the regiment
lost a field-officer, Major Thompson, who was killed in
the trenches on the night of the 28th, and on the same
night Brevet-Major Murphy was wounded. In the final
assault on the 6th of April, the escalade of the castle was
the duty allotted to the third division. Lieutenant
Whitelaw of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> volunteered to lead
the advance of twenty men, but less fortunate than his
brother officer, Lieutenant Mackie at Ciudad Rodrigo,
fell at the moment of victory; Captain Lindsay of the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> was also killed while in the act of raising
a ladder for his company to escalade the castle wall;
three other Lieutenants were killed (Mansfield, Cotton,
and Macalpine); and one Captain (Peshall) and four
Lieutenants (Faris, Armstrong, Davern, and Grattan)
wounded. Mr. Thomas Martin, eldest son of Richard
Martin, Esq., many years M.P. for Galway, who had
joined the regiment as a volunteer soon after the opening
of the trenches and accompanied the grenadiers in the
assault, was also wounded in the shoulder. The total
loss of the regiment before Badajoz, during the sieges in
June, 1811, and in March and April, 1812, amounted
to eight officers, five serjeants, and forty-two rank and
file killed; and eight officers, ten serjeants, and one hundred
and sixty-six rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>After the fall of <i>Badajoz</i>, the regiment returned to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
frontiers of Beira, where it remained till the army again
took the field in June. At the battle of <i>Salamanca</i>,
(22nd July) the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>, together with the
Forty-Fifth and Seventy-Fourth, formed the right
brigade of the third division, which was posted on the
right of the army, opposite to the Seventh French division,
under General Bonnet. Lieutenant-General Picton
being at this time absent from the field on account of ill-health,
the division was commanded by Major-General
the Honourable Edward Pakenham, the brigade by
Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander Wallace of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>,
and the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> itself by Major Seton,
who had succeeded to that rank upon the death of Major
Thompson in the trenches at Badajoz. It was five in
the afternoon, when Lord Wellington rode up and desired
Major-General the Hon. E. Pakenham to move the
third division forward, and carry the heights and guns
in his front. The division was at this time formed in
open column, right in front, facing a hill behind which
the French were posted, and on which were erected two
batteries. The colours were just uncased, and the bayonets
fixed, when Lieutenant-Colonel Wallace addressed
a few animating words to the men, explaining their situation,
and cautioning them to be aware of the enemy’s
cavalry, which was watching them closely, and hanging
on their flank: to the officers he said, “Gentlemen, the
regiment is on this day, as it generally is on such
occasions, tolerably strong, and (pointing to the batteries
which crowned the hill in front) we are likely to
have a good deal of noise about our ears. I would recommend
you to place yourselves in the centre and front
of your companies, which will prevent any mistake.”</p>

<p>The brigade now moved forward in one column, the
Forty-Fifth leading, followed immediately by the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
the enemy opened a heavy fire from fourteen
guns, which was replied to by a brigade of nine-pounders
firing over the heads of the advancing column. When
the smoke cleared away, Bonnet’s division was perceived
advancing rapidly round the face of the hill, as if determined
to anticipate attack; Major-General Pakenham
now rode up to Lieutenant-Colonel Wallace and ordered
him to wheel the brigade into line without halting, a
manœuvre which evidently disconcerted the enemy, who
nevertheless continued to advance with drums beating
and keeping up a heavy fire of musketry. In spite of
the enemy’s fusillade, Major-General Pakenham, Lieutenant-Colonel
Wallace, and Majors Seton and Murphy,
remained at the head of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>, which
formed the centre of the brigade, and continued to advance
steadily in line with firelocks on the rest. As the
British advanced, the fire of the enemy slackened, and
they seemed inclined to give way, when several of their
officers advanced in front to animate the men, and one
officer of the Twenty-Second, (the leading regiment of
the French column,) seizing a firelock, ran out in front
of his men and shot Major Murphy of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
through the heart. At the same moment a ball
struck the pole of the King’s colour, cutting it nearly in
two, and taking the epaulette off the shoulder of Lieutenant
D’Arcy who carried it. The men now, for the
first time, became impatient, and called out for revenge;
Major-General Pakenham cheered, and desired Lieutenant-Colonel
Wallace to <em>let them loose</em>; the men rushed
into the midst of the fire, and a close and desperate, but
short, conflict took place. The deep and ponderous
column, so formidable in attack, was now completely
overthrown, and at the mercy of its assailants; many of
the French were killed and wounded, and the broken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
column pursued for about a quarter of a mile through an
extensive but thinly-planted wood of cork-trees. At
this moment a shout in the rear caused the pursuers to
expect to have a charge of French cavalry to repel, but
they were agreeably disappointed by having Major-General
Le Marchant’s brigade of heavy cavalry to
greet, instead of a fresh enemy to resist. The French
could not withstand this new attack, and the whole
column, originally seven thousand strong, was cut to
pieces or captured, together with two eagles and eleven
pieces of cannon.</p>

<p>Owing to the previous casualties at Ciudad Rodrigo
and Badajoz, only four Captains were present with the
regiment at Salamanca, and of these, one (Captain
Mackie) acted as Aide-de-Camp to Lieutenant-Colonel
Wallace, and when the heavy brigade charged, joined
them in the attack. Two others (Murphy, brevet-major,
and Hogan) were killed, and the fourth (Captain Adair)
so severely wounded, as to survive the effects only a
few months. Captain Tryon of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>,
D.A.A.G., was likewise severely wounded. The <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
had also four Lieutenants (Meade, Nickle,
Grattan, and Kingsmill) wounded; one serjeant and
eighteen rank and file killed, and one serjeant and one
hundred and nine rank and file wounded; the total of
casualties amounting to seven officers and one hundred
and twenty-nine non-commissioned officers and privates.</p>

<p>After the battle of Salamanca the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
formed part of the corps which occupied Madrid during
Lord Wellington’s march to Burgos, and on the evacuation
of that capital in October following, returned to
quarters in Portugal, where it received a strong detachment
of the Second battalion, which again raised its
effective strength to near one thousand rank and file.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
For the first time, also, since its arrival in the Peninsula,
it was furnished with tents in common with the other
regiments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813</div>

<p>On the 16th of May, 1813, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> broke
up from its cantonments at Leomel, and joined in the
general advance of the army into Spain, under the command
of Lieutenant-Colonel Macpherson. In the course
of the march an accident occurred both annoying and
prejudicial to the regiment. In order to facilitate the
movements of the army, to render the column of march
less encumbered, and to lessen the fatigue of the troops,
it was customary, when not in the presence of the enemy,
to proceed either by brigades or single corps: Major-General
Sir Thomas Brisbane’s brigade, of which the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> formed part, moved by regiments.
The <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>, on the route from Leomel to St.
Jean de Pasquera, arrived at a spot where the road
branched off in different directions, one leading to its
proper point of destination, the other descending into the
steep and precipitous country which forms the left bank
of the Douro. By some unaccountable ignorance or
misconception on the part of its guide, the regiment took
the wrong road, and after struggling for some time
through a series of rugged defiles, found itself at a late
hour in the evening embedded in the mountains, and as
distant from St. Jean de Pasquera as it had been when
starting from its cantonments at Leomel. Some men
died of the heat and fatigue, but the <i lang="fr">esprit de corps</i>
sustained the regiment through the long and severe
forced march, across a country deeply intersected with
ravines, thickly covered with gum cistus, and traversable
only by goat-paths, by which it rejoined its division.</p>

<p>On the 27th of May the regiment entered Spain, and
on the 20th of June, it was posted near the river Bayas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
when dispositions were made for attacking the enemy in
his position in front of Vittoria.</p>

<p>The troops were under arms an hour before daylight
on the 21st, and the third and seventh divisions were
destined to attack the enemy’s centre; but the French,
having weakened their centre to support their flanks,
which were first attacked, the centre column of the allied
army did not meet with serious opposition. In front of
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> the enemy occupied a hill of considerable
elevation, from which he was forced by that
regiment, while the Forty-Fifth and Seventy-Fourth
made flank movements round its base, the French retiring
to a second hill in the rear of their former position. The
<span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>, which had hitherto been in column,
now deployed into line, and notwithstanding a heavy fire
of musketry and artillery, continued to advance, till the
enemy having rallied and brought up fresh troops, there
was momentary halt by order of Sir Thomas Brisbane,
who commanded the brigade. At this instant Lieutenant-General
Sir Thomas Picton coming up, and feeling
displeased at the halt, made use of some harsh expressions
to the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> as the leading corps,
which led to an immediate explanation from Sir Thomas
Brisbane, when the regiment again moved forward and
headed the brigade in the attack upon the town of Vittoria.
During the day the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> charged
several times, but the enemy never waited to receive
them, and it was generally observed among the soldiers,
that so far as this regiment was concerned, King
Joseph’s army at Vittoria proved decidedly the worst
fighting army they had encountered.</p>

<p>The loss of the regiment at Vittoria was one officer,
Ensign Saunders, and thirty rank and file killed; four
officers, Captain M‘Dermott, and Lieutenants Flood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
Fitzpatrick, and Faris; two serjeants, and one hundred
and ninety-five rank and file wounded; in all, two hundred
and thirty-two.</p>

<p>The expressions used by Sir Thomas Picton became
afterwards the subject of remonstrance, and even of a
memorial to the Duke of Wellington. The result was
that, after due explanations, a letter satisfactory to the
regiment was addressed by Sir Thomas Picton to Sir
Thomas Brisbane, as Commander of the brigade, declaring
that, after the many instances of gallantry he had
witnessed in the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>, it could never have
been his intention to cast any reflections on that corps,
by words uttered in a moment of irritation, and adding,
that his divisional order after the battle should be received
as a sufficient proof of this. The following is an
extract of that order:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">“<i>Division Orders, 23rd June, 1813.</i><br></p>

<p>“Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Picton congratulates
Major-General the Honourable Sir C. Colville, Major-General
Brisbane, and Major-General Power, upon
the conspicuous services rendered by the brigades under
their several commands towards the brilliant success
of the 21st of June instant. He requests to assure the
commanding officers, officers, non-commissioned officers
and men of their corps and regiments, that their conduct
did not fail to excite his warm admiration, and to
increase the confidence he has always felt in the command
of the third division,” &amp;c.</p>
</div>


<p>On the 28th of July, two companies of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
had an opportunity of earning distinction for
themselves and their corps under the immediate eye of
the whole third division, as well as of a strong and select
body of the French. The attempt of Marshal Soult to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
raise the siege of Pampeluna, which had been invested
by the Duke of Wellington’s army shortly after the
battle of Vittoria, and the series of actions which took
place between the covering army and that of Soult in
the passes of the Pyrenees between the 25th and 30th
of July, which ended in the complete repulse of the
French, gave rise to the display of British valour with
a splendour never exceeded in the annals of war.
The allied army was posted immediately in front of
Pampeluna, the right in front of the village of Huarte,
the third division being to the right, and those of
Lieutenant-General Cole, and Major-General the Honourable
E. Pakenham, together with the Spaniards,
to the left. The main efforts of Soult during the day
were directed against the allied left, but about five in the
afternoon, some of his tirailleurs were pushed forward as
if to feel the countenance of the third division, and
ascertain whether its position would be seriously defended
or not. The light company of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>,
commanded by Captain Robert Nickle (late Lieutenant-Colonel
of the Thirty-Sixth Foot) was ordered to drive
them back, which it speedily accomplished: a select body
of French, headed by an officer of the staff, who had volunteered
for that service, now advanced to support the
repulsed tirailleurs, and two battalion companies of the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> hurried to the assistance of their comrades.
The skirmish, fought in sight of the two armies,
took almost the type of a national trial of skill and courage;
the French rushed forward with their characteristic
impetuosity, shouting “Vive l’Empereur;” the <span class="smcap">Connaught
rangers</span>, accompanied by the cheers of their division,
met them with the bayonet, and overthrew them
at the first onset. The French commanding officer was
left on the field mortally wounded; Captain Nickle, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
soon as the conflict was decided, went up to render any
assistance in his power to his fallen antagonist, and, finding
him already dead, tied his handkerchief on the point
of his sabre, and waving it towards the retreating French,
beckoned to them to return for the body of their officer,
which they did, and carried him off to render the last
honours to his remains.</p>

<p>During the movements of the succeeding day, when
the allied army resumed the offensive, a heavy column of
French infantry was routed by Major-General Brisbane’s
brigade, and the greater part made prisoners by the
Forty-Fifth, Seventy-Fourth, and <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>.
After this the third division re-occupied the pass of Roncesvalles,
where it remained till the 8th of August, when
Major-General Brisbane’s brigade was relieved by
Colonel Downie’s brigade of Spaniards, and proceeded
by the valley of Los Alduides to the pass of Maya.</p>

<p>On the 31st of August the whole of the third division
crossed the frontiers of France, and Major-General Brisbane’s
brigade occupied the pass of Echalar, replacing
there the Seventh division, which had proceeded to reinforce
the troops before St. Sebastian; on the 4th, however,
it returned to the pass of Maya, and on the 15th
resumed its old position near the village of Erisoun, and
remained in the valley of Bastan till the 7th of October,
when, in consequence of the left of the army having
crossed the Bidassoa and entered France, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
and the rest of the division moved to the village
of Zagarramundi to the right and in front of the pass of
Echalar.</p>

<p>During this interval (9th of September, 1813) Lieutenant-Colonel
Taylor joined the regiment, and superseded
Lieutenant-Colonel Macpherson in the command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span></p>

<p>The colours of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> bear testimony
that it had its share on the 10th of November, in the
storming of the formidable lines which the French had
erected on the river <i>Nivelle</i>, and in the various actions
which took place on the banks of the <i>Nive</i>, between the
9th and 13th of December; but on neither of these occasions
had it the good fortune to come into actual contact
with the enemy. On the 17th of December it went
into cantonments in the village of Urcuray, situated on
the high road leading from Bayonne to St. Jean Pied de
Port, and the adjacent hamlets, where it remained till
the army again moved forward in February following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814</div>

<p>In the battle of <i>Orthes</i>, 28th of February 1814, the
third division was directed to attack the heights on which
the enemy’s centre and left stood, and the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
had once more an opportunity of distinguishing
itself, when its loss was more severe than on any other
occasion, except the siege of Badajoz. The Fifty-Second
led the attack; the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> advanced
on the right; the heights were carried, and the regiment
advancing in pursuit, its left flank was charged by a body
of French cavalry, which it entirely overthrew, killing,
wounding, or taking prisoners the whole detachment,
which was hemmed in in a narrow road, and precluded
from all retreat. In this battle, Captain Oates’s conduct
was particularly noticed, and procured for him the Brevet
rank of Major in the army. The loss of the battalion
was three officers, Captain M‘Dermott, Lieutenant Moriarty,
and Ensign Reynolds, five Serjeants and thirty-six
Rank and File killed; and eleven Officers, Lieutenant-Colonel
Taylor, Captains Oates and Bunworth,
Lieutenants Fitzpatrick, Davern, Faris, Creswell, Holland,
and Stewart, Ensign M‘Intosh, Ensign and Adjutant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
Mitchell, thirteen Serjeants, and two hundred and
one Rank and File wounded. Total, two hundred and
seventy-seven.</p>

<p>After this severe action the regiment was placed in
cantonments until the 13th of March, when it again took
the field, and was present on the 4th of April, at the
battle of <i>Toulouse</i>. Although only three companies of
the regiment were engaged on this occasion, they had the
good fortune to perform a critical and important service,
in supporting the Forty-Fifth and Seventy-Fourth when
engaged with very unequal numbers of the enemy. The
Light Infantry Company, in particular, suffered, and its
Captain, R. Nickle, was severely wounded: the loss of
the three companies in killed, was equal to that of the
whole battalion at Vittoria, amounting to one Serjeant
and twenty-nine Men; the wounded were Captain Nickle
and Lieutenant Poole, one Serjeant, and fifty-three Rank
and File.</p>

<p>The Serjeant who fell at Toulouse, was much regretted
by the whole corps; his name was Thorpe, and he was
Serjeant-Major of the battalion. He had been originally
Drum-Major, in which capacity he was present at
the battle of Busaco: on that occasion, when ordered
with the band and drummers, to the rear, he entreated
his commanding officer to allow him to join his company,
and having obtained permission he fell into the ranks,
behaving with the utmost gallantry throughout that memorable
day. This, and other instances of his courage,
induced Lieutenant-Colonel Wallace to consider him
qualified for a higher situation, and to remove him from
the band into the line. He had for some time been recommended
for a commission, to which the Gazette which
arrived from England a few days after his death, contained
his appointment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span></p>

<p>The peace of Paris in 1814, having put an end to the
war on the Continent, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> Regiment
was among the corps ordered to proceed to America,
where hostilities were still raging. It embarked in the
Gironde on the 15th of June, under the command of
Lieutenant-Colonel Macpherson, and, without returning
to England, sailed direct to Quebec, where it arrived on
the 3rd of August following. The unfortunate failure of
the combined military and naval operations on Lake
Champlain and at Plattsburgh put a stop to active hostilities
in Canada, and the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> had only one
opportunity of coming into contact with the enemy, viz.,
at the passage of the Savannah, where the light company,
under Captain Nickle, distinguished itself.</p>

<p>If, however, the period of its stay in Canada was
barren of laurels to the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>, it gave the regiment
an opportunity of displaying qualities which, if
not so dazzling and brilliant, are equally valuable in, and
honourable to the soldier, namely, firm discipline and
unshakeable fidelity to his king, his country, and his
colours. The extent to which desertion prevailed
amongst the British troops in America, is unhappily but
too well known; but although the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> was
stationed on the banks of the river Richelieu, within a
few hours’ sail of the province of Vermont; although the
men were considerably in debt to their officers, and under
stoppages to pay off an incumbrance, of which desertion
would at once have relieved them; although tempting
rewards awaited such as should reach the American territory,
which could be done without the slightest risk;
although American ships were daily arriving and departing,
and the facilities were such that, if so disposed, the
whole battalion might have deserted in a night, the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> <em>did not lose one man by desertion</em>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
during the whole eleven months that it remained in
Canada!!</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815</div>

<p>This honourable conduct of the men of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
did not go unnoticed or unrewarded; their
reward was exemption from the painful duty of being
present when the extreme sentence of martial law was
executed upon deserters from other regiments. The following
is a copy of the brigade order on one occasion of
the kind, more than nine months after the arrival of the
regiment in America.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">“<i>St. John’s, May 19, 1815.</i></p>

<p>“No men having deserted from Major Green’s artillery,
or from the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> regiment, they will
not be required to attend at Chambly for the purpose
of witnessing the execution of the sentence of a General
Court Martial on several deserters.”</p>
</div>


<p>The subject was again honourably adverted to by
Major-General Brisbane, in a letter addressed to the regiment
in Brigade Orders, when, in consequence of the
escape of Napoleon from Elba, and the prospect of renewed
and active warfare in Europe, it had been
ordered to return to England.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“B. O.</p>

<p>“Major-General Sir Thomas Brisbane was much
pleased this day with the general appearance and movements
of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> Regiment. He cannot
refrain from expressing how much, and how sincerely
he regrets losing a regiment with which he has so long
served, and which has conducted itself so creditably
since its arrival in this country; but he confidently
looks forward to have it again in his brigade. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
circumstance of the regiment <em>never having lost a man
by desertion</em> is highly honourable to it, and can never
be forgotten by the Major-General.</p>

</div>


<p>On the 29th of May the regiment marched from St.
John’s, reached William Henry on the 1st of June,
where it embarked in small craft, and arrived at Trois
Rivieres on the 4th. At Trois Rivieres it was shifted
into transports, reached Quebec on the 8th, sailed again
on the 10th, and arrived at Spithead on the 15th of
July.</p>

<p>The battle of Waterloo had decided the contest in
Europe before the arrival of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>; nevertheless
the regiment was ordered to proceed, without disembarking,
to Flanders. After two days’ stay, therefore,
at Spithead, it sailed again on the 17th, and landed
at Ostend on the 21st of July. From thence it proceeded
towards Paris, and on the 12th of August took up its
quarters at St. Denis, and was once more attached to Sir
Thomas Brisbane’s brigade. In December following it
was removed to that of Sir John Keane, on which occasion
Major-General Brisbane caused the following letter
to be addressed to Colonel Wallace, who had again taken
command of the regiment.</p>

that his best wishes accompany them, and he will
always be happy to have again under his command a

during the seven years they have been with him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1816<br>1817</div>

<p>From January, 1816, to the end of the spring, 1817,
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> was in garrison at Valenciennes,
when it returned to Great Britain, and was quartered in
Edinburgh about two years. Some time after its arrival
in Scotland, a letter was received from Lieutenant-General
the Honourable Sir Charles Colville, who had frequently
had it under his command, as part of the third
division, in the Peninsula, and more recently during its
stay at Valenciennes, “expressing his hearty wish for
the honour and well-being of the regiment in whatever
situation it may be placed, and requesting the Officers,
Non-Commissioned Officers and Privates, to accept his
thanks for the ready attention paid to his orders during
the period the regiment was under his command.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">1818</div>

<p>During the period of repose at Edinburgh, it occurred
to Colonel Wallace to establish an <em>Order of Merit</em>
in the regiment, by conferring some honorary mark of
distinction on the non-commissioned officers and privates,
proportioned to their regimental character, length of service,
and the number of general engagements in which
they had been present. This was, however, a design
which could not be carried into execution without the
consent and approbation of the Commander-in-Chief,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
which Colonel Wallace applied for in the following
letter:—</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">“<i>Edinburgh Castle, June 4, 1818.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>“I have the honour to state, that some of the non-commissioned
officers and soldiers of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
Regiment have served in twelve different
general actions, and have been two, three, and four
times wounded, have been a long time in the regiment,
and always conducted themselves well in the field and
in quarters. I am anxious to bestow upon them some
mark of distinction for their good conduct, as an encouragement
to them and others in future.</p>

<p>“I shall be much obliged to you if you will obtain
His Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief’s permission
for me to give such men medals as a testimony
of their merit.</p>

<p class="right"><span style="margin-right: 6.5em;">“I have, &amp;c.,</span><br>

“Colonel Commanding.</p>

<p>“<i>To the Adjutant-General.</i>”</p>
</div>


<p>The answer of the Commander-in-Chief, communicated
in a letter from Sir Henry Torrens, dated 28th
of the same month, sanctioned Colonel Wallace’s plan,
leaving it to his “discretion to grant such testimonials in
the case alluded to, as he might deem essential to the
good of the regiment.” The proper authority thus
obtained, Colonel Wallace’s intentions were carried into
effect without delay. Silver medals of three distinct
classes were struck at the expense of the officers of the
regiment. The first class was bestowed on men who had
been present in twelve general actions, and consisted of a
Maltese cross on which the names of the twelve actions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
were stamped. The second class was given to those who
had served in from six to eleven general actions, and the
third to such as had served in any number less than six.
The name of the man to whom it was given was engraved
on each medal. The total number distributed
was,—</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819</div>

<p class="p1">On the 11th of March, 1819, Lieutenant-General Sir
Gordon Drummond, G.C.B., was appointed Colonel of
the Regiment, in succession to Lieut.-Gen. Viscount Beresford,
who was removed to the Sixty-Ninth Regiment.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1819, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> moved
from Edinburgh to Hull, sending detachments to Manchester
and Stockport. In August of the same year,
Colonel Wallace, after more than fourteen years’ service
with the regiment, was promoted to the rank of Major-General,
and was succeeded in the command by Lieutenant-Colonel
James Ferguson.</p>

<p>During the time the regiment was quartered at Hull,
the manufacturing districts of England were in a high
state of discontent, and attempts were made to circulate
inflammatory publications amongst the military. Private
James Tracy, of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>, being tampered with
for this purpose, received the papers, but, instead of distributing
them amongst his comrades, instantly gave them
up to his commanding officer, Major Nickle, furnishing,
at the same time, such information as led to the apprehension
and conviction of the man from whom he had
received them. For this conduct Tracy received a liberal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
reward, as well as the approbation of Lieutenant-General
Sir John Byng, commanding the district, which was
conveyed to him through a letter to Colonel Ferguson.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1821<br>1822<br>1823</div>

<p>From Hull the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> removed to Chester,
and from thence, in the summer of 1821, to Liverpool,
where it embarked for Ireland, landed at Dublin, and
proceeded to Enniskillen, where it took up its head-quarters,
furnishing sixteen officers’ detachments. In
July, 1822, it moved from Enniskillen to Castlebar in
Connaught, where it remained, again furnishing fifteen
officers’ detachments, till December, 1823, when it
marched to barracks at Naas. On quitting Castlebar it
received a very flattering address from the magistrates
and resident gentlemen of the town and neighbourhood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1824</div>

<p>On the 16th of January, 1824, Lieutenant-General Sir
Gordon Drummond was removed to the Seventy-First
regiment, and the Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> was
conferred upon Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Frederick
Campbell, K.C.B., G.C.H.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1825</div>

<p>It was February, 1825, before the last detachment
joined from Connaught, when the regiment, once more
united, removed to Dublin, occupying first the Richmond,
and subsequently the Royal barracks. While the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> remained in Dublin, orders were issued
for increasing the establishments of regiments from eight
to ten companies. The zealous exertions of Lieutenant-Colonel
Ferguson, aided by the high popularity the
corps enjoyed, enabled the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> to complete
its numbers in little more than six weeks, and to be the
first regiment reported as complete to the Commander-in-Chief,
a circumstance honourably noticed in a letter
from the Adjutant-General of the Forces to Major-General
Sir Colquhoun Grant, then commanding the garrison
of Dublin, under date of 20th of June, 1825. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
have it in command,” says the letter of the Adjutant-General,
“to express His Royal Highness’s approbation
of the zeal manifested by Lieutenant-Colonel Ferguson,
the commanding officer, in thus rapidly raising
the augmentation, and which being the first instance of
completion yet reported, is most creditable to that
officer, and the corps under his command.”</p>

<p>In the latter part of the summer of 1825, the regiment
removed to Templemore, furnishing fourteen detachments
in the counties of Tipperary and Limerick. Here
Lieutenant-Colonel O’Malley joined on the 10th of August,
and took the command in place of Lieutenant-Colonel
Ferguson, who had been removed to the Fifty-Second
Regiment. In September it received orders for
the Mediterranean, embarked by divisions at Cork on
the 7th and 21st of October and 12th of December, 1825,
and proceeded to Corfu, where the last division arrived
on the 27th of January, 1826.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1828</div>

<p>During the year 1828 the regiment furnished several
detachments to the neighbouring islands of Ithaca, Cerigo,
Calamos, and Santa Maura; the detachment in the
last-named island suffered severely from a malignant fever
which raged during the months of June, July, and
August, and carried off thirty-six men out of seventy-five,
of which it originally consisted. On the 19th of
September, the head-quarters were removed to Cephalonia,
on which occasion Major-General Woodford took
leave of it in the following very flattering terms:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 12.5em;">“<span class="smcap">Garrison Orders</span>.</span><br>
“<i>Brigade-Major’s Office, Corfu,<br>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">“Sept. 18th, 1828.</span></i></p>

<p>“Major-General Woodford will not allow the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
regiment to embark without his expressing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
satisfaction he feels at the invariably good conduct the
regiment has maintained in the garrison. Its interior
order and general soldier-like appearance sufficiently
evince the assiduous attention which has been bestowed
on the regulation and discipline of the corps. The
Major-General feels this tribute to be due to Lieutenant-Colonel
O’Malley, and he requests he will communicate
his sentiments to the regiment.”</p>
</div>


<div class="sidenote">1830</div>

<p>In April, 1830, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> again returned
to Corfu, where it remained until September, 1831, when
it was removed to Vido, and continued there until December,
1831, when it again proceeded to Corfu. The
reserve companies remained in Ireland from 1825, to
April, 1830, when they embarked for England.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>From the time of its original formation, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
regiment had, as stated at the commencement of
the Record, borne on its colours and appointments a
device, consisting of a Harp and Crown, with the motto
“<i lang="la">Quis separabit?</i>” No direct authority appears to have
authorised this appropriation of a badge and motto, but
use had sanctioned it, and the recollection of the fields of
glory in which it had waved before the enemy, endeared
it to the sympathies of the officers and men. In an official
design for a new stand of colours preparing for the
regiment towards the end of 1830, this device and motto
were omitted. Colonel O’Malley immediately wrote to
the Adjutant-General representing the case, and the
strong wishes of the regiment for its retention, for the
consideration of the Commander-in-Chief. His application
was successful, and obtained distinct authority for
the corps to continue the use of the badge to which it
was so strongly and so reasonably attached. The Adjutant-General,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
in a letter dated from the Horse-Guards,
30th of December, 1830, says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“Sir,</p>

<p>“I have had the honour to submit to the General
Commanding-in-Chief your letter of the 22nd instant
with its enclosures, and am directed to acquaint you,
that under the circumstances therein stated, his Lordship
has been pleased to obtain his Majesty’s permission,
that the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> Regiment, or ‘<span class="smcap">Connaught
Rangers</span>,’ may retain on its colours and appointments
the <span class="smcap">Harp</span> and <span class="smcap">Crown</span>, with the motto
‘<i lang="la">Quis separabit?</i>’ in addition to the badges and devices
which it has been authorized to bear in commemoration
of its distinguished services on various occasions.</p>

<p class="right"><span style="margin-right: 5.5em;">“I have, &amp;c.,</span><br>
“<span class="smcap">John Macdonald</span>, A.G.</p>

<p>“<i>Colonel O’Malley, Eighty-Eighth Regiment.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p class="p1">The <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> regiment having been omitted
among the regiments authorised to bear, as an honorary
distinction, the word “<em>Pyrenees</em>” on its Colours, the
Commanding Officer, Lieutenant-Colonel O’Malley, in
the year 1830, made the most strenuous exertions to
obtain this additional honour for the regiment, in commemoration
of its services in the actions in the Pyrenees,
as narrated at <a href="#Page_52">pages 52, &amp;c.;</a> and testimonials of its
gallant conduct on the occasions in question, were furnished
by Major-General Sir Thomas Brisbane, who
commanded the brigade of which the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
formed a part,—by Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Frederick
Stovin, who acted as Assistant-Adjutant-General to the
third division,—and by Lieutenant-Colonel James Campbell,
who was Major of Brigade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span></p>

<p>This omission occurred in consequence of the officer
who commanded the regiment on the occasion alluded
to, not having received a medal for that service, perhaps
owing to an accident, or clerical error at the time; but,
as Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Picton, who commanded
the third division, fell in the battle of Waterloo,
the requisite form of recommendation for honours of this
description could not be procured, and the General Commanding-in-Chief
did not feel himself justified in departing
from the general rule which had been established,
as the ground on which these distinctions should be submitted
for the King’s approval. This honorary inscription
is, consequently, not borne on the colours of the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> regiment, for its services in the Pyrenees.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1831</div>

<p>On the 20th October, 1831, Lieutenant-General Sir
Henry Frederick Campbell, K.C.B., was removed to the
Twenty-Fifth regiment, and Major-General Sir John
Alexander Wallace, Bart. and K.C.B., who had commanded
the regiment in many of the arduous campaigns
during the Peninsular war, was appointed to the Colonelcy
of the <span class="smcap">Connaught Rangers</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> regiment continued in Corfu
from the year 1830 to 1836, furnishing occasionally
working parties for the island of Vido, and detachments
to Santa Maura, and the other islands: the detachment
to Santa Maura in April, 1832, continued there ten
months, and consisted of two Captains, three Subalterns,
one Assistant-Surgeon, six Serjeants, two Drummers,
and one hundred and fifty Rank and File.</p>

<p>To those persons interested in the well-being of the
corps, and who recollect the extent of sickness and mortality
experienced by a former detachment at this station,
and of not more than half the strength, in the year 1828,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
it will be gratifying to know, that not more than two
deaths took place, neither of which was caused by climate,
one of them was accidental drowning, and the other the
consequence of <i lang="la">delirium tremens</i>; indeed, such was the
health of this detachment, that the hospital was, for the
greater part of the time, unoccupied during its stay at
Santa Maura.</p>

<p>From the period of the return of the regiment from the
Island of Cephalonia to Corfu, Major-General Sir Alexander
Woodford, in making his half-yearly inspections,
expressed in every instance his approbation of the corps,
more especially in June, 1831, when he addressed a letter,
of which the following is a copy, to Major O’Hara, then
Commanding Officer, upon whom, and the regiment
altogether, the sentiments expressed by the Major-General
reflect much credit:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">“<i>Corfu, 6th June, 1831.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">“Sir,</p>

<p>“Having now inspected the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> regiment,
twice within six months, and having on both occasions
found it in high order, I have a satisfactory
duty to perform, in desiring you will communicate to
the regiment my approbation of its soldier-like appearance,
its interior order, and its general steadiness
under arms.</p>

<p>“I beg you will intimate to the Officers, that their attention
to their duties, and to the good order and
management of their companies, is very apparent; and
that, from the direction thus given to the men, in the
care and keeping of their arms, accoutrements, and appointments,
and in everything relating to their equipment
and personal appearance, arise, in my opinion,
the good humour and contentment, and consequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
regularity and discipline, which characterise the regiment.</p>

<p>“To the Non-Commissioned Officers and Men, I
desire you will state, that I am perfectly satisfied with
them, individually, as clean, smart, and well-behaved
soldiers, and collectively as a corps, highly creditable
to the King’s service.</p>

<p>“In conveying these observations to the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
regiment assembled on parade, you will, Sir,
receive yourself the best testimony I can give, to the
care and attention with which you have discharged
your own superior duties.</p>

</div>


<p class="p1">Nothing of importance connected with the history of
the regiment, occurred from the date of its return to
Corfu, with the exception of the melancholy circumstance
of Captain the Honourable Charles Gustavus
Monckton having been assassinated by a villain, private
James Clarke, on the 9th August, 1831, under the impression,
as it is believed, that his being accidentally met
out of barracks at a late hour of the night, by Captain
Monckton, when in the act of committing felony, might
tend to his conviction thereof.</p>

<p>The constitution of a regiment is such that the acts of
individuals, more or less, reflect honour or disgrace on
the whole corps, and much of the fame and high character
to which the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> regiment has claim, would
perhaps be tarnished, if grounds existed for imagining
that any other individual belonging to it was concerned
in this diabolical act; the feelings evinced by the soldiers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
of the regiment, particularly those of the company to
which the assassin belonged, when forgetful of the forbearance
due to religion and to the laws, they were with
difficulty restrained from taking vengeance, as well as
their subsequent conduct in requesting to be permitted
to subscribe one dollar (4<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>) per man, to erect a monument
to the memory of their much-lamented officer,
and thereby make known to posterity, their horror and
indignation at the disgraceful occurrence, are convincing
proofs that no other soldier was implicated in this disgraceful
transaction.</p>

<p>The request of the regiment was acquiesced in; at
the same time it was deemed prudent to limit the subscription
of the Non-Commissioned Officers and Privates,
to one day’s pay each, with which a monument has been
erected in the military burial-ground of Corfu.</p>

<p>The following notification was made to the regiment
on this occasion:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">“<i>Corfu, 15th March, 1833.</i><br></p>

<p>“The Colonel commanding has much pleasure in announcing
to the regiment, that the Monument to the
memory of the late Honourable Captain Monckton has
been completed, and now stands over the grave of that
much-lamented officer, in the military burial-ground
of this garrison. This mark of esteem and regard for
the deceased reflects much credit and honour upon the
regiment, more especially, as the expense attending it
has been paid by the voluntary subscriptions of the
Non-Commissioned Officers and Soldiers who generously
offered one dollar per man towards it, which
Colonel O’Malley feels quite assured they would as
cheerfully have paid, if necessary, and if permitted to
do so, as they have readily contributed one day’s pay,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
to which it was deemed prudent to limit their contribution.”</p>
</div>


<p>The monument bears the following inscription in
English, and in Greek, viz.:—</p>

<p class="pfs80">
SACRED<br>
To the Memory of<br>
THE HONOURABLE CHARLES GUSTAVUS MONCKTON,<br>
Late Captain in<br>
His Majesty’s Eighty-Eighth Regiment (or Connaught Rangers),<br>
Who died by the hand of an Assassin, on the 9th August, 1831,<br>
Aged Twenty-Six years.<br>
This Monument is erected by the Non-Commissioned Officers and Private<br>
Soldiers of the Regiment, in testimony of their respect and regard<br>
for this most lamented young Officer, and to record their<br>
abhorrence of the atrocious act by which he was<br>
deprived of life.<br>
The feeling of grief and indignation, strongly and universally expressed<br>
by the Regiment, was only moderated on witnessing the prompt<br>
punishment of the murderer, Private James Clarke, who<br>
was executed on the 11th August, 1831.<br>
</p>


<div class="sidenote">1833</div>

<p class="p1">It may be here told, in further justice to the feelings
of the men of the company to which this assassin Clarke
belonged, that such was the horror of the wretch’s memory
amongst them, that not one of those soldiers could be
prevailed with, unless positively ordered, to receive, and
do duty with the arms and accoutrements which had
been in his charge, and this having come to the knowledge
of the Commanding Officer, in March, 1833, when
a draft of men was received from the reserve companies,
which made it necessary to bring in use some spare arms
and accoutrements, Colonel O’Malley (in proof of his
acquiescence in the feeling) caused the accoutrements
and appointments in question to be cut in pieces on the
parade of the regiment, and the objectionable firelock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
was delivered into the Ordnance stores in exchange for
another.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1834</div>

<p>The ceremony of presenting new colours to the regiment,
took place at Corfu on the 27th of February, 1834,
<em>the anniversary of the battle of Orthes</em>, in which the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> regiment bore a distinguished part,
and suffered a severe loss in officers and men.</p>

<p>The presentation of colours, which is under any circumstances
interesting, caused on the present occasion
an unusual excitement, it being known that they were
to be given by Lady Woodford, the wife of Major-General
Sir Alexander Woodford, commanding the
troops in the Ionian Islands. A vast concourse of
people, with all the beauty and fashion of the place,
assembled at an early hour on the esplanade of the
citadel, which is finely situated, commanding a view of
the rugged and snow-topped mountains of Albania, of
the sea, and of the fertile hills of the island covered with
olives, and green with the opening vegetation of an early
spring. The fineness of the day was in unison with the
beauty of the scenery, and nature herself seemed to
smile on the expected ceremony. The Lord High Commissioner,
Lord Nugent, the President of the Senate,
and the Senators with their families, and the nobility
and gentry of the island, honoured the corps with their
presence.</p>

<p>The regiment being assembled and drawn up in line,
at about eleven o’clock Lady Woodford arrived in her
carriage, attended by the Major-General and his Staff on
horseback; and on her Ladyship’s descending in front of
the line, the regiment presented arms, the band playing
“God save the King.” The grenadier company then
moved from the right, and drew up facing the centre of
the battalion: having opened its ranks, it presented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
arms to the old colours, of which it took charge, and
escorted them to the citadel, the regiment presenting
arms to them. Shortly afterwards the grenadiers returned
with the new colours, which had been consecrated
on the previous Sunday, and had remained in the garrison
chapel. These were delivered by the Rev. Charles
Küper to the Major and senior Captain, by whom they
were borne to the parade, where those officers placed
themselves on either side of Lady Woodford, continuing
to hold the colours unfurled. The grenadiers having
resumed their place on the right of the line, the regiment
formed three sides of a square, leaving the fourth open
to the public. During this formation, in order that a
suitable impression might be made on their young minds,
the school children of the regiment (boys and girls),
neatly and uniformly dressed in green, moved into the
square.</p>

<p>Ensigns Herbert and Honeywood, upon whom the
honour of receiving the colours devolved, were then ordered
to advance towards Lady Woodford, when her
Ladyship delivered the colours to those officers, with the
following exhortation:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="pad2">“Gentlemen,</p>

<p>“Receive and guard with fidelity, in every danger,
these Colours which I have the honour of presenting
to you! May the Almighty protect and prosper
you in this sacred duty, and may you live to be distinguished
in your country’s service!”</p>
</div>

<p>At this moment a light breeze expanded the Colours,
emblazoned with the names of the many battles in which
the corps had borne a distinguished part, and a simultaneous
burst of admiration and applause issued forth from
the numerous spectators.</p>

<p>The Ensigns then moved to their places in the line of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
Officers; as they advanced, the regiment presented arms,
the band playing “God save the King.”</p>

<p>The Major-General then stepped forward and addressed
the regiment in the following terms:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Colonel O’Malley, Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers,
and Privates of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> regiment, I
have witnessed the presentation of your Colours with
peculiar interest and satisfaction.</p>

<p>“To a regiment whose bravery in the field has ever
been conspicuous, few words can be necessary on this
occasion; but as your Colours are a sacred pledge
which binds you to your duty and your country, I
cannot pass over in silence a ceremony which calls forth
every warm and honourable feeling that ought to animate
a soldier’s breast.</p>

<p>“This day, the anniversary of the battle of Orthes,
reminds us of a period when the valour and discipline
of the British arms rendered it everywhere triumphant,
under that great commander who led it from victory
to victory.</p>

<p>“In those active and arduous campaigns, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
regiment, from first to last, bore a most distinguished
part, under the command of that gallant
officer who is now your Colonel<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<p>“The records of its meritorious services in those hard
fought battles, emblazoned on these colours which are
now confided to your trust, will be to you a proud
memorial of the past, and a stimulus for days to come.</p>

<p>“There are other corps, too, in this command, who
equally shared in those glorious successes, and in reverting
to their own gallant conduct, they will attest,
and they can well appreciate the ardour and gallantry
of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span></p>

<p>“Nor can I pass over a fact not less honourable to
the corps than even brilliant achievements in the field,
I allude to the campaign in Canada, where the inducement
to desertion was great, but where your men, without
one single exception, spurned every attempt to
seduce them from their colours and their duty; a memorable
instance of their love of country, and of their
fidelity to the service, which rendered them worthy of
their native land, and an honour to the British army.</p>

<p class="p1 pad2">“Colonel, Officers, and Soldiers,</p>

<p>“The good spirit and discipline which pervade your
ranks are the best presages of your future conduct,
wherever you may be called.</p>

<p>“In your hands, Sir, warmly supported as you are by
the officers around you, with your vigilance, your perseverance,
and your zeal for the welfare of the regiment,
I feel persuaded that its reputation and high
name will ever be nobly maintained.</p>

<p>“With respect to you, Soldiers, there never was a
period when the country had stronger claims on your
attachment; when the regulations of the service so
carefully provide for your maintenance, your comfort,
and your protection, while serving; your support and
honourable retirement, when age and infirmity render
you incapable of active duty; and I may say, with
confidence, there never was a time when the British soldiers
were more sensible of the advantages they enjoy—more
firm in their allegiance—more faithfully devoted
to their King and country.</p>

<p>“And whenever your services shall again be required
to encounter the enemies of our country in the field,
need I say to the <span class="smcap">Connaught Rangers</span>, by these
Colours you must stand or fall—with these Colours
you must conquer or perish?”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span></p>

<p>The Commanding Officer, Colonel O’Malley, replied
to the Major-General as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It becomes my duty for the Officers, Non-Commissioned
Officers, and Soldiers of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>,
to return thanks to you, Lady Woodford, and to you,
Sir Alexander, for the honour done to us this day; in
performing which duty, I feel, with much regret, how
very incapable I am to do justice to the occasion, or to
the grateful feelings towards you, which animate me
and every individual of the regiment.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Rangers</span>! the Colours you have just received have
been in my possession above two years, in which I have
watched over them with a constant and anxious desire
to witness their delivery to you. Unavoidable circumstances
have hitherto prevented this, more especially,
which we all have viewed with deep sympathy and
regret, the long and severe indisposition of Lady
Woodford. We have now, however, thanks to the
Almighty, the great satisfaction to see her Ladyship on
this parade in renewed health and strength; under
any circumstances you would receive with pleasure and
honour throughout your lives, those Colours, borne as
they are on the old and wounded poles which accompanied
the regiment through many successful and
triumphant battles, and with the only remaining fragments
of the old Colours attached to them; but tenfold
will be your satisfaction in having received them
through the hands of Lady Woodford, a circumstance
in itself which could not fail to insure them your respect
and devotion; of this I was fully aware, when in your
name I solicited her Ladyship to present those Colours.</p>

<p>“In reference to them, identified as they are with the
history and gallant achievements of the regiment, I
might, and would say much, and that without a fear of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
the charge being made against me, of sounding my
own praises, (for, unhappily, I had no share in the
deeds of glory to which I allude); but my feelings, excited
by the very impressive address that the Major-General
has had the goodness to make to us, and by
the interesting presentation of the Colours by Lady
Woodford, altogether unfit me for the task.</p>

<p>“To gain the good opinion and the confidence of those
General Officers under whose orders we may serve,
should at all times be our study; to succeed must in
any case be gratifying; but in the instance of so very
distinguished an officer as Sir Alexander Woodford,
who so thoroughly knows what a British soldier is and
ought to be; and after a period of seven years, in
which we have served under his orders, in the course
of which he has acquired an intimate knowledge of us
as a regiment, it is flattering and grateful in the extreme
to me, as it is to you, Officers and Soldiers, to
have heard the Major-General speak as he has done of
the good spirit and discipline which pervade our ranks.</p>

<p>“We owe it to ourselves never to be unmindful of this
address, and I pray you to recollect what I have frequently
impressed on you, that not only by bravery in
war can the honour of your Colours be upheld, but
also by a steady perseverance in good and regular conduct,
and let us ever bear in mind, that valour without
discipline is of no avail.”</p>
</div>

<p>The square was then reduced, and the regiment being
in line, fired a <i lang="fr">feu de joie</i>, the drums beating a point of
war between each fire, and at the close the band played
“God save the King;” after which the regiment gave
three hearty cheers in honour of the occasion. The regiment
then broke into column and marched past, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
Officers saluting, and the line being re-formed, opened
its ranks, advanced, and again presented arms.</p>

<p>At two o’clock, the whole of the Non-Commissioned
Officers and Soldiers, with their families, were provided
with an excellent dinner on the parade in the citadel.</p>

<p>The Service Companies embarked from Corfu on board
the Barosa troop ship, under command of Major Eden,
on 29th July, 1836, and landed at Portsmouth the 23rd
of September, where they joined the Depôt Companies
after a separation of nearly eleven years, those companies
having arrived only <em>two</em> days previously from Ireland.</p>

<p>The Depôt Companies after being moved from Ireland
to Languard Fort and Harwich in 1830, continued to
occupy those quarters until July, 1832, when they
moved to Chatham, leaving a detachment of one company
at Harwich, under command of Captain Orr; on
the 1st January, 1833, Major O’Hara joined and assumed
the command of the depôt, Major Eden having
proceeded to join the Service Companies, and in this
year the depôt moved to Sheerness, where Captain Orr’s
detachment joined in June from Harwich, on quitting
which place Captain Orr received a letter expressive of
the admiration of the Mayor, Justices, and Inhabitants,
of the good conduct of the detachment, of which letter
and of Captain Orr’s reply, the following are copies,
viz.:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><i>“Harwich, 12th June, 1833.</i></p>

<p>“Sir,—By the desire of the Mayor and Justices of

I have to communicate to you the expression of their
admiration of the conduct of the detachment of the

during their long services on this station, as having
been of the most exemplary and praiseworthy description.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
I beg to assure you how much gratified I
am by the honour of this instrumentality.</p>

</div>


<p>In June, 1834, the depôt marched in <em>two</em> divisions
from Sheerness, and returned to Chatham, where, soon
after, one of those incidental riots took place between
some soldiers and some of the seamen and labourers in
the Dock-yard, which, as in most cases of the kind, originated
from some trifling cause, and was in the first instance
considered of no importance; but unhappily it
shortly after assumed a more grave and serious form, as
very frequent opportunities were taken to grossly insult
and assault the soldiers, who, though fully impressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
with that good sense of discipline which commands forbearance,
were forced in self-defence to retaliate. Again,
on the 21st August, after the races, an altercation took
place between some soldiers and sailors, the origin of
which could not be ascertained, but the sailors were
joined by a vast rabble of the lowest kind, who aided in
seriously maltreating the soldiers, whose numbers being
comparatively few, acted alone in self-defence, until
some of the well-disposed of the inhabitants ran to the
barracks and gave notice to the guard of what was passing:
when the soldiers in barracks were made aware of
it, they rushed therefrom to the aid of their comrades,
some of whom they met, in appearance frightfully
maimed, the consequences of which might have been
most serious, had not the Officers of the depôt hurried
forward and arrested the advance of the soldiers, who in
obedience to orders immediately returned to the barracks.
In the course of this proceeding, no interference was
made by the civil authorities, nor on the following day
when a party of seamen in a state of intoxication, accompanied
by a vast rabble armed with bludgeons, and
preceded by persons with musical instruments, marched
up to the barrack-gate and called for the soldiers of the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>, to come out for fight, and decide the
affray of the previous day, a challenge which no doubt
would have been readily accepted, more especially as the
men were termed cowards, &amp;c. had not the serjeant of
the barrack-guard and his men done their duty by keeping
their comrades within the walls, until the Commanding
Officer and Officers were made aware of what was
passing, and ordered the barrack-gates to be closed, and
thus terminated this threatened fight. A detailed report
of these proceedings was made by the Officer commanding
the depôt to the Commandant of Chatham, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
complaint against the military having been forwarded in
the name of the inhabitants of that place, a Court of
Enquiry of <em>five</em> Officers (Major Dubourdieu of the Provisional
Battalion, President) was assembled on the 1st
September for the investigation of the complaints, of
which due notice was given to the complainants, with an
invitation to attend and support the charges they had
preferred: notwithstanding which, not one individual appeared
before the court; and however blameable the civil
authorities may be considered for their non-interference
to check the scenes which took place, it may be justly
inferred that no guilt could be established against the
military, more especially, as such a report was made for
the General Commanding-in-Chief’s information, as
brought a letter from the Adjutant-General, expressive
of Lord Hill’s satisfaction at the exertions of Major
O’Hara and that of the Non-Commissioned Officers, in
supporting his exertions to prevent and stop the irregular
proceedings which took place, of which letter the following
is a copy, viz.:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">“<i>Horse-Guards, 20th September, 1834.</i></p>

the detailed explanation which the Major has submitted

exertions on that occasion, as the contrary line of conduct

</div>


<p>The depôt marched in two divisions to Dover, on the
6th and 8th of September, and arrived on the 10th and
12th. They occupied the Western Height Barracks, giving
a detachment to the Castle until the 3rd of January,
1835, when the entire of the depôt were moved to the
Castle. Soon after its arrival in Dover it actively assisted
with the Artillery in extinguishing a fire, for which the
thanks of the inhabitants were received; and after being
quartered in Dover for eleven months, it embarked for
Ireland in the Messenger steamer, the 5th August. The
feeling of the inhabitants at its departure will be best
understood by reading the following description thereof,
extracted from the “Dover Telegraph,” which, with a
letter from the Magistrates, and a garrison order, on the
occasion, sufficiently refute the calumny cast on the corps
when at Chatham.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><cite>From the Dover Telegraph.</cite></p>

<p class="pfs80">DEPARTURE OF THE EIGHTY-EIGHTH.</p>

<p>The official documents which follow this article, so
justly embody the sentiments of the chief civil and military
authorities of the town and garrison, on the uniform
good conduct of the depôt companies of the <span class="smcap">Connaught
Rangers</span>, since they have been stationed here, as to leave
us but the alternative of referring to our humble testimony
in their favour on the first arrival of their route
for Ireland.</p>

<p>That the inhabitants of all ranks fully concur in these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
testimonies, is best proved by the voices of the <em>thousands</em>
assembled to greet them with a farewell cheer. At five
o’clock on Wednesday evening, the depôt marched from
their quarters in the Castle through the town to the new
cross wall, where they were immediately embarked on board
the Messenger steamer, and from that hour till nearly
half-past eight, the piers and quays were literally crowded
with the largest concourse of persons witnessed there for
many years. During the flowing of the tide the brass
band gave their final entertainment, by performing
several national and appropriate airs in their acknowledged
excellent style, and considerable amusement was
afforded to those near the vessel by the leave-takings of
the soldiers’ female friends, most of whom seemed more
desirous of taking leave to accompany them. At nearly
half-past eight the Messenger was warped into the middle
of the harbour, and presently afterwards the paddle
wheels were in motion. At this moment the most perfect
silence was observed by the troops, an arrangement that
seemed necessary for every order being distinctly heard,
relative to navigating in the harbour a vessel of eight
hundred tons, propelled by machinery of two hundred
horse power. But no sooner had she passed the boom-house
jetties, than the cheers of the troops burst forth in
a genuine Hibernian hurra, which was immediately answered
most cordially by the multitude assembled on the
piers, and continued for some minutes. The band played
“Rule Britannia” as the ship glided majestically to sea,
and in a few minutes the <span class="smcap">Connaught Rangers</span> were out
of sight and progressing towards their native land.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1835</div>

<p>We have entered more into detail than is usual on the
embarkation of a single corps, but the peculiarly disadvantageous
circumstances under which the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
arrived at Dover, thus contrasted with the interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
excited by their departure, after a stay of nearly
twelve months amongst us, we think may warrant our
doing so, as a proof that the odium attached to the corps
at Chatham was undeserved. We now turn cheerfully
to the documents before alluded to, the communication
from the town clerk, and the garrison order of Colonel
Arnold, viz.:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

act of justice to the regiment, to state their great satisfaction

<p>Copy of a Garrison Order issued by the Commanding

<span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> regiment:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">“<i>Dover, 3rd August, 1835.</i></p>

<p>“The depôt of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> regiment being
about to embark for Cork, Colonel Arnold cannot suffer
it to leave Dover without expressing his high sense of
its excellent and exemplary conduct since it has been
stationed here, and which he has frequently had much
satisfaction in reporting to his Lordship the General
Commanding-in-Chief. By its correct and soldier-like
behaviour, the depôt of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> regiment
has fully supported in garrison the high character which
that distinguished corps has always maintained in the
field, and conciliated the respect and regard of the inhabitants
generally, by whom Colonel Arnold is confident
its departure will be greatly regretted, and he sincerely
wishes the depôt health and prosperity.</p>

<p class="right"><span style="margin-right: 3.5em;">(Signed)&nbsp; &nbsp;  “<span class="smcap">T. B. Arnold</span>, Colonel,</span><br>
“Royal Engineers, Commg. the Garr.”</p>
</div>


<div class="sidenote">1836</div>

<p>On the arrival of the Messenger steamer at the Cove
of Cork, orders were received to convey the depôt to
Kinsale, where it disembarked the 10th September, and
went into barracks at Charles Fort, from which a company
was detached to Bandon on the 14th. On the 6th
October, the depôt was inspected by Major-General Sir
Thomas Arbuthnot, K.C.B., commanding the southern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
district, who expressed himself highly satisfied with it in
every particular. On 19th October, Assistant-Surgeon
Douse, Lieutenant Mackie, with one serjeant, and twenty-one
privates, proceeded to Spike Island, where (with the
exception of Surgeon Douse, promoted to the 14th foot,
who was replaced by Assistant-Surgeon Dalmage) they
remained until the 9th February, 1836, when they embarked
in the Bristol freight ship to join the service
companies at Corfu. On the 31st March, a company
was detached to Dunmanway.</p>

<p>The depôt received the route for Nenagh, and two
companies, with head-quarters, marched from Charles
Fort on the 19th of April, detaching, <i lang="fr">en route</i>, a company
to Killaloe, and relieved the depôt of the 27th regiment
at Nenagh, on the 27th. The companies at Bandon
and Dunmanway joined head-quarters on the 12th May,
and the depôt was inspected by Major-General Sir James
Douglas, K.C.B., commanding the south-western district,
on the 14th, who was pleased to say, “he had seen
no depôt of which he should make a more favourable
report.”</p>

<p>A letter, of which the following is a copy, was received
by Captain Rutherford, commanding the detachment
at Bandon, on his departure from that town:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">“<i>Bandon, 2nd May, 1836.</i></p>

<p>“Sir,—We the undersigned inhabitants of the town
and neighbourhood of Bandon, having learned with
regret that you are about to be removed with the detachment
under your command of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
regiment, consider it but justice to express to you
before your departure, our perfect satisfaction at the
regular and strict propriety of conduct of the men of
your distinguished corps while they have been stationed
here, now upwards of seven months; thus proving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
to their friends at home, as they have often done to
their enemies abroad, what can be effected by uniform
steadiness and high discipline.</p>

<p>“We beg you to accept and express to your men,
our very best wishes for yours and their happiness
and success, and the great satisfaction we shall feel,
should the <span class="smcap">Connaught Rangers</span> at any future period
be quartered among us.”</p>

<p>Signed by the Honourable <span class="smcap">Wm. Bernard</span>, Provost
of Bandon, eight Magistrates, ten Clergymen, and one
hundred and forty-eight of the most respectable and influential
inhabitants of the town and neighbourhood.</p>
</div>


<p>To the foregoing Captain Rutherford made the following
reply:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To the Provost, Magistrates, Clergymen, and Inhabitants
of the town and neighbourhood of Bandon.</p>

<p class="right">“<i>Bandon, 3rd May, 1836.</i></p>

<p>“Gentlemen,—I have the honour to acknowledge the
receipt of your very flattering address of the 2nd inst.</p>

<p>“That the conduct of the men of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>
regiment, since they have been quartered here, has
elicited the approbation of so numerous and highly
respectable a body of the inhabitants, is to me, as I
am sure it will be to every officer of the corps, a source
of the greatest gratification.</p>

<p>“The regret you express at the departure of the detachment,
and the satisfaction it would afford, should
the <span class="smcap">Connaught Rangers</span> at any future period return
to Bandon, must be fully participated in by every individual
who has had the good fortune to be stationed
here, where the officers have received such general and
friendly attention, and where the men have witnessed
such cordiality and good feeling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span></p>

<p>“With a deep sense of the honour you have conferred,
not only on me, but the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> regiment
if generally,</p>

<p class="right"><span style="margin-right: 5.5em;">“I have the honour to remain,</span><br>
<span style="margin-right: 1.5em;">“Your very obedient humble servant,</span><br>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">(Signed)&nbsp; &nbsp;  “<span class="smcap">H. W. Rutherford</span>,</span><br>
“Capt. 88th, Commandg. Detach.”</p>
</div>


<p class="p1">The depôt marched from Nenagh to Buttivant on the
9th June, where it arrived on the 14th, and received
orders to hold itself in readiness to embark for England,
which it did in September following, on board the
Athol troop ship, and joined the service companies at
Portsmouth, on the 23rd of that month, when they
landed from Corfu.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1837</div>

<p>The regiment continued to do duty in the garrison of
Portsmouth nearly eleven months, in the course of which
time it was twice inspected by Major-General Sir Thomas
M‘Mahon, K.C.B., who, on each occasion, expressed his
most unqualified approbation of it in every particular,
and his intention to report accordingly to the General
Commanding-in-Chief. Whilst at Portsmouth the regiment
discharged nine serjeants and ninety-two rank and
file, most of them after long service, worn out and unfit
for further service; those numbers were, however, recruited
in the course of fourteen weeks, forty-one of
whom were chosen from disbanded soldiers of Evans’s
legion on their return from Spain, and the regiment discontinued
to recruit. It marched for Weedon Barracks,
Northamptonshire, in three divisions, on the 14th, 15th,
and 16th August, 1837, and on the 20th of September,
it was inspected by Lord Hill, General Commanding-in-Chief,
when his Lordship was pleased to express himself
in high terms of approbation. After a stay of only seven
weeks at this most desirable station, it again marched in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
four divisions into Lancashire, on 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th,
of October, to Bolton (head-quarters), Wigan, Haydock
Loch, and Liverpool.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>, or <span class="smcap">Connaught Rangers</span>, though
comparatively a young regiment, has performed much arduous
service. A few months after it was embodied, it
was engaged in operations against the enemy in Flanders
and Holland, and shared in all the difficulties and privations
of a winter campaign in 1794. A portion of the
corps was afterwards employed in active operations in the
West Indies. In a few years it appeared on the shores
of India; and it formed the van of the Indian army
through the deserts of Egypt. In South America the
<span class="smcap">Connaught Rangers</span> performed their duty as gallant
soldiers: and throughout the Peninsular campaigns their
services are associated with the <em>Third Division</em> of the
British army, which was eminently distinguished for gallantry.
After a series of victories in Europe, the services
of the regiment were transferred to North America,
where it was distinguished for a praiseworthy national
feeling, which is inherent in brave men, and was evinced
by the absence of desertion. Its services may be estimated
from the circumstance, that in a period of six
years it lost forty-three Officers, twenty-eight of whom
fell in the field; the remainder died from wounds, from
the effects of climate, or from fatigue; and its loss in
Non-Commissioned Officers and Privates during the
same period, and from the same causes, was above two
thousand. Since the termination of the war, this regiment,
whether on home service, or in garrison abroad,
has been eminent for good conduct; and its past services
furnish a laudable incentive to perseverance in well-doing,
to all who have the honour of being enrolled under its
Colours.</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak fs90">SECOND BATTALION OF THE EIGHTY-EIGHTH
REGIMENT.</h2>


<p>This battalion was composed of recruits raised in Ireland,
for limited service, under the authority of the
Additional Force Act, which passed 4th of July, 1804,
and was placed on the establishment of the army, December
25th of the same year. It was formed at Dumfries,
in Scotland, in November, 1805, under the command of
Lieutenant-Colonel John Alexander Wallace, embarked
at Leith for the Thames, and landing at Gravesend,
marched into Sussex, where it occupied various quarters,
and furnished, from time to time, reinforcements for the
First Battalion. In January, 1807, it returned to Ireland,
and was quartered principally in Connaught, where
it recruited numerous volunteers from the Irish militia
regiments.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1809 it embarked from Cork for
Lisbon; but on its arrival, and subsequent inspection
there, it was sent, in consequence of the youth of the
men, to Gibraltar, and did duty in that garrison for a
few months. From Gibraltar it was ordered, under the
command of Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor, to Cadiz, in
which city it was quartered during the operations against
Fort Matagorda. After the reduction of that fort it was
encamped for two or three months in the Isla de Leon,
under the command of Major (afterwards Lieutenant-Colonel)
Macpherson, and assisted in the construction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
of the lines thrown up for the defence of that island
against the French. A short time before Lieutenant-General
Sir Thomas Graham engaged in the expedition
which led to the battle of Barossa, the Second Battalion
of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> was ordered again to Lisbon,
where Colonel Taylor resumed the command.</p>

<p>In the pursuit of Massena’s army from the lines of
Torres Vedras, the second battalion, under the command
of Major Dunne, was attached to the third division of
the army. It was engaged in the action at Sabugal,
and was present in the operations of the army down to
the storming of Badajoz, after which, it furnished, as
formerly stated, a large draft of men to the First Battalion
and returned to England. In the end of 1813 it
was ordered to Ireland, for the greater facility of recruiting.
The very liberal encouragement which Lieutenant-General
Lord Beresford afforded to this service, enabled
Major Dunne to obtain a number of volunteers from the
Irish militia; the liberality of the Colonel, and the judicious
management of the Commanding Officer, were so
successful, that in two months the battalion was increased
from one hundred and forty to eight hundred strong.
It continued in Ireland, furnishing occasional drafts to
the First Battalion until January, 1816, when it was
finally reduced at Clare Castle, after transferring all the
men who were fit for service to the 1st battalion, then
quartered in France.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> It may not be improper, in this place, to notice and correct
an erroneous report which became prevalent in England, that
the troops engaged in the assault of Buenos Ayres were ordered,
not only to advance unloaded, but actually to take the flints out
of their muskets. The fact is, that two companies of the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span> only were thus deprived of every means of offence
or defence except their bayonets; they had been on a
piquet the night before at “White’s House,” and, consequently,
joined their corps in the morning with loaded arms; the order
to draw their charges occasioning some delay, General Gower,
who was present, became impatient, and directed those who had
not drawn to take their flints out. The consequence was, that
several of these men were killed in the streets while in the act
of screwing in new flints.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> General Reid was head of an ancient Scotch family, and
served as a Lieutenant in Loudon’s Highlanders in 1745. In
1759 he was appointed Major of the Forty-Second, in which regiment
he continued until 1771. In 1780 he was appointed
Colonel of the Ninety-Fifth Foot, a newly-raised regiment, and
continued to command it until it was disbanded in 1783. In
1794, as stated in the text, he became Colonel of the Connaught
Rangers. His commissions as a General Officer were, Major-General
19th October, 1781; Lieutenant-General 12th October,
1793; and General 1st January, 1798.</p>

purpose of being Pay-Serjeant to Captain Bray, who exchanged from the <span class="smcap">Eighty-Eighth</span>,
with Captain Hutton. Cahill was on board the Kent East Indiaman,
when she took fire in the Bay of Biscay, and from the account given by Captain
Bray, his conduct and extraordinary exertions on that trying occasion were most
exemplary and conspicuous. Having lost his Medal (which was of the First Class)
and all his necessaries, the Non-Commissioned Officers and Privates of the Light
Company (in which Company Cahill served during the whole of the Peninsular
war) made a subscription amongst them of Five Pounds to purchase him a kit,
which sum was sent to him by Lieutenant and Adjutant Souter, who at the same
time made him the present of a Medal, which he forwarded through the Horse
Guards.</p>
